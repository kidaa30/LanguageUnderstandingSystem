of
this
british
industrial

.
a
form
of
asbestos
once
used
to
make
kent
cigarette
filters
has
caused
a
high
percentage
of
cancer
deaths
among
a
group
of
workers
exposed
to
it
more
than
30
years
ago
,
researchers
reported
.
the
asbestos
fiber
,
crocidolite
,
is
unusually
resilient
once
it
enters
the
lungs
,
with
even
brief
exposures
to
it
causing
symptoms
that
show
up
decades
later
,
researchers
said
.
lorillard
inc.
,
the
unit
of
new
york-based
loews
corp.
that
makes
kent
cigarettes
,
stopped
using
crocidolite
in
its
micronite
cigarette
filters
in
1956
.
although
preliminary
findings
were
reported
more
than
a
year
ago
,
the
latest
results
appear
in
today
's
new
england
journal
of
medicine
,
a
forum
likely
to
bring
new
attention
to
the
problem
.
a
lorillard
spokewoman
said
,
``
this
is
an
old
story
.
we
're
talking
about
years
ago
before
anyone
heard
of
asbestos
having
any
questionable
properties
.
there
is
no
asbestos
in
our
products
now
.
''
neither
lorillard
nor
the
researchers
who
studied
the
workers
were
aware
of
any
research
on
smokers
of
the
kent
cigarettes
.
``
we
have
no
useful
information
on
whether
users
are
at
risk
,
''
said
james
a.
talcott
of
boston
's
dana-farber
cancer
institute
.
dr.
talcott
led
a
team
of
researchers
from
the
national
cancer
institute
and
the
medical
schools
of
harvard
university
and
boston
university
.
the
lorillard
spokeswoman
said
asbestos
was
used
in
``
very
modest
amounts
''
in
making
paper
for
the
filters
in
the
early
1950s
and
replaced
with
a
different
type
of
filter
in
1956
.
from
1953
to
1955
,
9.8
billion
kent
cigarettes
with
the
filters
were
sold
,
the
company
said
.
among
33
men
who
worked
closely
with
the
substance
,
28
have
died
--
more
than
three
times
the
expected
number
.
four
of
the
five
surviving
workers
have
asbestos-related
diseases
,
including
three
with
recently
diagnosed
cancer
.
the
total
of
18
deaths
from
malignant
mesothelioma
,
lung
cancer
and
asbestosis
was
far
higher
than
expected
,
the
researchers
said
.
``
the
morbidity
rate
is
a
striking
finding
among
those
of
us
who
study
asbestos-related
diseases
,
''
said
dr.
talcott
.
the
percentage
of
lung
cancer
deaths
among
the
workers
at
the
west
groton
,
mass.
,
paper
factory
appears
to
be
the
highest
for
any
asbestos
workers
studied
in
western
industrialized
countries
,
he
said
.
the
plant
,
which
is
owned
by
hollingsworth
&
vose
co.
,
was
under
contract
with
lorillard
to
make
the
cigarette
filters
.
the
finding
probably
will
support
those
who
argue
that
the
u.s.
should
regulate
the
class
of
asbestos
including
crocidolite
more
stringently
than
the
common
kind
of
asbestos
,
chrysotile
,
found
in
most
schools
and
other
buildings
,
dr.
talcott
said
.
the
u.s.
is
one
of
the
few
industrialized
nations
that
does
n't
have
a
higher
standard
of
regulation
for
the
smooth
,
needle-like
fibers
such
as
crocidolite
that
are
classified
as
amphobiles
,
according
to
brooke
t.
mossman
,
a
professor
of
pathlogy
at
the
university
of
vermont
college
of
medicine
.
more
common
chrysotile
fibers
are
curly
and
are
more
easily
rejected
by
the
body
,
dr.
mossman
explained
.
in
july
,
the
environmental
protection
agency
imposed
a
gradual
ban
on
virtually
all
uses
of
asbestos
.
by
1997
,
almost
all
remaining
uses
of
cancer-causing
asbestos
will
be
outlawed
.
about
160
workers
at
a
factory
that
made
paper
for
the
kent
filters
were
exposed
to
asbestos
in
the
1950s
.
areas
of
the
factory
were
particularly
dusty
where
the
crocidolite
was
used
.
workers
dumped
large
burlap
sacks
of
the
imported
material
into
a
huge
bin
,
poured
in
cotton
and
acetate
fibers
and
mechanically
mixed
the
dry
fibers
in
a
process
used
to
make
filters
.
workers
described
``
clouds
of
blue
dust
''
that
hung
over
parts
of
the
factory
,
even
though
exhaust
fans
ventilated
the
area
.
``
there
's
no
question
that
some
of
those
workers
and
managers
contracted
asbestos-related
diseases
,

said
darrell
phillips
,
vice
president
of

resources
for

to
retain

higher

is

of

sheet
.
documents
filed
with

commission
on
the

disclosed
that

will
withdraw
the
almost
$
100
million
in
financing
it
is
providing
the
new
firm
if
mr.
cray
leaves
or
if
the
product-design
project
he
heads
is
scrapped
.
the
documents
also
said
that
although
the
64-year-old
mr.
cray
has
been
working
on
the
project
for
more
than
six
years
,
the
cray-3
machine
is
at
least
another
year
away
from
a
fully
operational
prototype
.
moreover
,
there
have
been
no
orders
for
the
cray-3
so
far
,
though
the
company
says
it
is
talking
with
several
prospects
.
while
many
of
the
risks
were
anticipated
when
minneapolis-based
cray
research
first
announced
the
spinoff
in
may
,
the
strings
it
attached
to
the
financing
had
n't
been
made
public
until
yesterday
.
``
we
did
n't
have
much
of
a
choice
,
''
cray
computer
's
chief
financial
officer
,
gregory
barnum
,
said
in
an
interview
.
``
the
theory
is
that
seymour
is
the
chief
designer
of
the
cray-3
,
and
without
him
it
could
not
be
completed
.
cray
research
did
not
want
to
fund
a
project
that
did
not
include
seymour
.
''
the
documents
also
said
that
cray
computer
anticipates
needing
perhaps
another
$
120
million
in
financing
beginning
next
september
.
but
mr.
barnum
called
that
``
a

the

that
cray
research
's
decision
to
link
its
$
98.3
million
promissory
note
to
mr.
cray
's
presence
will
complicate
a
valuation

either
believe
seymour
can
do
it
again
or
you
do
n't
.
''
besides
the
designer
's
age
,
other
risk
factors
for
mr.
cray
's
new
company
include
the
cray-3
's
tricky
,
unproven
chip
technology
.
the
sec
documents
describe
those
chips
,
which
are
made
of
gallium
arsenide
,
as
being
so
fragile
and
minute
they
will
require
special
robotic
handling
equipment
.
in
addition
,
the
cray-3
will
contain
16
processors
--
twice
as
many
as
the
largest
current
supercomputer
.
cray
computer
also
will
face
intense
competition
,
not
only
from
cray
research
,
which
has
about
60
%
of
the
world-wide
supercomputer
market
and
which
is
expected
to
roll
out
the
c-90
machine
,
a
direct
competitor
with
the
cray-3
,
in
1991
.
the
spinoff
also
will
compete
with
international
business
machines
corp.
and
japan
's
big
three
--
hitachi
ltd.
,
nec
corp.
and
fujitsu
ltd
.
the
new
company
said
it
believes
there
are
fewer
than
100
potential
customers
for
supercomputers
priced
between
$
15
million
and
$
30
million
--
presumably
the
cray-3
price
range
.
under
terms
of
the
spinoff
,
cray
research
stockholders
are
to
receive
one
cray
computer
share
for
every
two
cray

shares
they
own
in
a
distribution
expected
to
occur
in
about
two
weeks
.
no
price
for
the
new

has
been
set

instead
,
the

will
leave
it
up
to

to
decide
.

's
initial
book
value
at

.
along
with
the
note
,
cray
research
is
transferring
about
$
53
million
in
assets
,
primarily
those
related
to
the
cray-3
development
,
which
has
been
a
drain
on
cray

's
earnings
.
pro-forma
balance
sheets
clearly
show
why
cray
research
favored
the
spinoff
.
without
the
cray-3
research
and
development
expenses
,
the
company
would
have
been
able
to
report
a
profit
of
$
19.3
million
for
the
first
half
of

rather
than
the
$

trade
representative
carla
hills
announced
.
under
the
new
u.s.
trade
law
,
those
countries
could
face
accelerated
unfair-trade
investigations
and
stiff
trade
sanctions
if
they
do
n't
improve
their
protection
of
intellectual
property
by
next
spring
.
mrs.
hills
said
many
of
the
25
countries
that
she
placed
under
varying
degrees
of
scrutiny
have
made
``
genuine
progress
''
on
this
touchy
issue
.
she
said
there
is
``
growing
realization
''
around
the
world
that
denial
of
intellectual-property
rights
harms
all
trading
nations
,
and
particularly
the
``
creativity
and
inventiveness
of
an
{
offending
}
country
's
own
citizens
.
''
u.s.
trade
negotiators
argue
that
countries
with
inadequate
protections
for
intellectual-property
rights
could
be
hurting
themselves
by
discouraging
their
own
scientists
and
authors
and
by
deterring
u.s.
high-technology
firms
from
investing
or
marketing
their
best
products
there
.
mrs.
hills
lauded
south
korea
for
creating
an
intellectual-property
task
force
and
special
enforcement
teams
of
police
officers
and
prosecutors
trained
to
pursue
movie
and
book
pirates
.
seoul
also
has
instituted
effective
search-and-seizure
procedures
to
aid
these
teams
,
she
said
.
taiwan
has
improved
its
standing
with
the
u.s.
by
initialing
a
bilateral
copyright
agreement
,
amending
its
trademark
law
and
introducing
legislation
to
protect
foreign
movie
producers
from
unauthorized
showings
of
their
films
.
that
measure
could
compel
taipei
's
growing
number
of
small
video-viewing
parlors
to
pay
movie
producers
for
showing
their
films
.
saudi
arabia
,
for
its
part
,
has
vowed
to
enact
a
copyright
law
compatible
with
international
standards
and
to
apply
the
law
to
computer
software
as
well
as
to
literary
works
,
mrs.
hills
said
.
these
three
countries
are
n't
completely
off
the
hook
,
though
.
they
will
remain
on
a
lower-priority
list
that
includes
17
other
countries
.
those
countries
--
including
japan
,
italy
,
canada
,
greece
and
spain
--
are
still
of
some
concern
to
the
u.s.
but
are
deemed
to
pose
less-serious
problems
for
american
patent
and
copyright
owners
than
those
on
the
``
priority
''
list
.
gary
hoffman
,
a
washington
lawyer
specializing
in
intellectual-property
cases
,
said
the
threat
of
u.s.
retaliation
,
combined
with
a
growing
recognition
that
protecting
intellectual
property
is
in
a
country
's
own
interest
,
prompted
the
improvements
made
by
south
korea
,
taiwan
and
saudi
arabia
.
``
what
this
tells
us
is
that
u.s.
trade
law
is
working
,
''
he
said
.
he
said
mexico
could
be
one
of
the
next
countries
to
be
removed
from
the
priority
list
because
of
its
efforts
to
craft
a
new
patent
law
.
mrs.
hills
said
that
the
u.s.
is
still
concerned
about
``
disturbing
developments
in
turkey
and
continuing
slow
progress
in
malaysia
.
''
she
did
n't
elaborate
,
although
earlier
u.s.
trade
reports
have
complained
of
videocassette
piracy
in
malaysia
and
disregard
for
u.s.
pharmaceutical
patents
in
turkey
.
the
1988
trade
act
requires
mrs.
hills
to
issue
another
review
of
the
performance
of
these
countries
by
april
30
.
so
far
,
mrs.
hills
has
n't
deemed
any
cases
bad
enough
to
merit
an
accelerated
investigation
under
the
so-called
special
301
provision
of
the
act
.
argentina
said
it
will
ask
creditor
banks
to
halve
its
foreign
debt
of
$
64
billion
--
the
third-highest
in
the
developing
world
.
the
declaration
by
economy
minister
nestor
rapanelli
is
believed
to
be
the
first
time
such
an
action
has
been
called
for
by
an
argentine
official
of
such
stature
.
the
latin
american
nation
has
paid
very
little
on
its
debt
since
early
last
year
.
``
argentina
aspires
to
reach
a
reduction
of
50
%
in
the
value
of
its
external
debt
,
''
mr.
rapanelli
said
through
his
spokesman
,
miguel
alurralde
.
mr.
rapanelli
met
in
august
with
u.s.
assistant
treasury
secretary
david
mulford
.
argentine
negotiator
carlos
carballo
was
in
washington
and
new
york
this
week
to
meet
with
banks
.
mr.
rapanelli
recently
has
said
the
government
of
president
carlos
menem
,
who
took
office
july
8
,
feels
a
significant
reduction
of
principal
and
interest
is
the
only
way
the
debt
problem
may
be
solved
.
but
he
has
not
said
before
that
the
country
wants
half
the
debt
forgiven
.

two
key
advantages

are
designed
to
eliminate
the
risk
of
prepayment
--
mortgage-backed
securities
can
be
retired
early
if
interest
rates
decline
,
and
such
prepayment
forces
investors
to
redeploy
their
money
at
lower
rates

second
,
they
channel
monthly
mortgage
payments

by
addressing

the

have
become
``

attractive

it
's
the
latest
investment
craze
sweeping
wall
street
:
a
rash
of
new
closed-end
country
funds
,
those
publicly
traded
portfolios
that
invest
in
stocks
of
a
single
foreign
country
.
no
fewer
than
24
country
funds
have
been
launched
or
registered
with
regulators
this
year
,
triple
the
level
of
all
of
1988
,
according
to
charles
e.
simon
&
co.
,
a
washington-based
research
firm
.
the
turf
recently
has
ranged
from
chile
to
austria
to
portugal
.
next
week
,
the
philippine
fund
's
launch
will
be
capped
by
a
visit
by
philippine
president
corazon
aquino
--
the
first
time
a
head
of
state
has
kicked
off
an
issue
at
the
big
board
here
.
the
next
province
?
``
anything
's
possible
--
how
about
the
new
guinea
fund
?
''
quips
george
foot
,
a
managing
partner
at
newgate
management
associates
of
northampton
,
mass
.
the
recent
explosion
of
country
funds
mirrors
the
``
closed-end
fund
mania
''
of
the
1920s
,
mr.
foot
says
,
when
narrowly
focused
funds
grew
wildly
popular
.
they
fell
into
oblivion
after
the
1929
crash
.
unlike
traditional
open-end
mutual
funds
,
most
of
these
one-country
portfolios
are
the
``
closed-end
''
type
,
issuing
a
fixed
number
of
shares
that
trade
publicly
.
the
surge
brings
to
nearly
50
the
number
of
country
funds
that
are
or
soon
will
be
listed
in
new
york
or
london
.
these
funds
now
account
for
several
billions
of
dollars
in
assets
.
``
people
are
looking
to
stake
their
claims
''
now
before
the
number
of
available
nations
runs
out
,
says
michael
porter
,
an
analyst
at
smith
barney
,
harris
upham
&
co.
,
new
york
.
behind
all
the
hoopla
is
some
heavy-duty
competition
.
as
individual
investors
have
turned
away
from
the
stock
market
over
the
years
,
securities
firms
have
scrambled
to
find
new
products
that
brokers
find
easy
to
sell
.
and
the
firms
are
stretching
their
nets
far
and
wide
to
do
it
.
financial
planners
often
urge
investors
to
diversify
and
to
hold
a
smattering
of
international
securities
.
and
many
emerging
markets
have
outpaced
more
mature
markets
,
such
as
the
u.s.
and
japan
.
country
funds
offer
an
easy
way
to
get
a
taste
of
foreign
stocks
without
the
hard
research
of
seeking
out
individual
companies
.
but
it
does
n't
take
much
to
get
burned
.
political
and
currency
gyrations
can
whipsaw
the
funds
.
another
concern
:
the
funds
'
share
prices
tend
to
swing
more
than
the
broader
market
.
when
the
stock
market
dropped
nearly
7
%
oct.
13
,
for
instance
,
the
mexico
fund
plunged
about
18
%
and
the
spain
fund
fell
16
%
.
and
most
country
funds
were
clobbered
more
than
most
stocks
after
the
1987
crash
.
what
's
so
wild
about
the
funds
'
frenzy
right
now
is
that
many
are
trading
at
historically
fat
premiums
to
the
value
of
their
underlying
portfolios
.
after
trading
at
an
average
discount
of
more
than
20
%
in
late
1987
and
part
of
last
year
,
country
funds
currently
trade
at
an
average
premium
of
6
%
.
the
reason
:
share
prices
of
many
of
these
funds
this
year
have
climbed
much
more
sharply
than
the
foreign
stocks
they
hold
.
it
's
probably
worth
paying
a
premium
for
funds
that
invest
in
markets
that
are
partially
closed
to
foreign
investors
,
such
as
south
korea
,
some
specialists
say
.
but
some
european
funds
recently
have
skyrocketed
;
spain
fund
has
surged
to
a
startling
120
%
premium
.
it
has
been
targeted
by
japanese
investors
as
a
good
long-term
play
tied
to
1992
's
european
economic
integration
.
and
several
new
funds
that
are
n't
even
fully
invested
yet
have
jumped
to
trade
at
big
premiums
.
``
i
'm
very
alarmed
to
see
these
rich
valuations
,
''
says
smith
barney
's
mr.
porter
.
the
newly
fattened
premiums
reflect
the
increasingly
global
marketing
of
some
country
funds
,
mr.
porter
suggests
.
unlike
many
u.s.
investors
,
those
in
asia
or
europe
seeking
foreign-stock
exposure
may
be
less
resistant
to
paying
higher
prices
for
country
funds
.
``
there
may
be
an
international
viewpoint
cast
on
the
funds
listed
here
,
''
mr.
porter
says
.
nonetheless
,
plenty
of
u.s.
analysts
and
money
managers
are
aghast
at
the
lofty
trading
levels
of
some
country
funds
.
they
argue
that
u.s.
investors
often
can
buy
american
depositary
receipts
on
the
big
stocks
in
many
funds
;
these
so-called
adrs
represent
shares
of
foreign
companies
traded
in
the
u.s.
.
that
way
investors
can
essentially
buy
the
funds
without
paying
the
premium
.
for
people
who
insist
on
jumping
in
now
to
buy
the
funds
,
newgate
's
mr.
foot
says
:
``
the
only
advice
i
have
for
these
folks
is
that
those
who
come
to
the
party
late
had
better
be
ready
to
leave
quickly
.
the
u.s.
and
soviet
union
are
holding
technical
talks
about
possible
repayment
by
moscow
of
$
188
million
in
pre-communist
russian
debts
owed
to
the
u.s.
government
,
the
state
department
said
.
if
the
debts
are
repaid
,
it
could
clear
the
way
for
soviet
bonds
to
be
sold
in
the
u.s.
.
however
,
after
two
meetings
with
the
soviets
,
a
state
department
spokesman
said
that
it
's
``
too
early
to
say
''
whether
that
will
happen
.
coincident
with
the
talks
,
the
state
department
said
it
has
permitted
a
soviet
bank
to
open
a
new
york
branch
.
the
branch
of
the
bank
for
foreign
economic
affairs
was
approved
last
spring
and
opened
in
july
.
but
a
soviet
bank
here
would
be
crippled
unless
moscow
found
a
way
to
settle
the
$
188
million
debt
,
which
was
lent
to
the
country
's
short-lived
democratic
kerensky
government
before
the
communists
seized
power
in
1917
.
under
a
1934
law
,
the
johnson
debt
default
act
,
as
amended
,
it
's
illegal
for
americans
to
extend
credit
to
countries
in
default
to
the
u.s.
government
,
unless
they
are
members
of
the
world
bank
and
international
monetary
fund
.
the
u.s.s.r.
belongs
to
neither
organization
.
moscow
has
settled
pre-1917
debts
with
other
countries
in
recent
years
at
less
than
face
value
.
the
state
department
stressed
the
pre-1933
debts
as
the
key
to
satisfying
the
johnson
act
.
but
the
soviets
might
still
face
legal
obstacles
to
raising
money
in
the
u.s.
until
they
settle
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
additional
debt
still
outstanding
from
the
world
war
ii
lend-lease
program
.
in
another
reflection
that
the
growth
of
the
economy
is
leveling
off
,
the
government
said
that
orders
for
manufactured
goods
and
spending
on
construction
failed
to
rise
in
september
.
meanwhile
,
the
national
association
of
purchasing
management
said
its
latest
survey
indicated
that
the
manufacturing
economy
contracted
in
october
for
the
sixth
consecutive
month
.
its
index
inched
up
to
47.6
%
in
october
from
46
%
in
september
.
any
reading
below
50
%
suggests
the
manufacturing
sector
is
generally
declining
.
the
purchasing
managers
,
however
,
also
said
that
orders
turned
up
in
october
after
four
months
of
decline
.
factories
booked
$
236.74
billion
in
orders
in
september
,
nearly
the
same
as
the
$
236.79
billion
in
august
,
the
commerce
department
said
.
if
not
for
a
59.6
%
surge
in
orders
for
capital
goods
by
defense
contractors
,
factory
orders
would
have
fallen
2.1
%
.
in
a
separate
report
,
the
department
said
construction
spending
ran
at
an
annual
rate
of
$
415.6
billion
,
not
significantly
different
from
the
$
415.8
billion
reported
for
august
.
private
construction
spending
was
down
,
but
government
building
activity
was
up
.
the
figures
in
both
reports
were
adjusted
to
remove
the
effects
of
usual
seasonal
patterns
,
but
were
n't
adjusted
for
inflation
.
kenneth
mayland
,
economist
for
society
corp.
,
a
cleveland
bank
,
said
demand
for
exports
of
factory
goods
is
beginning
to
taper
off
.
at
the
same
time
,
the
drop
in
interest
rates
since
the
spring
has
failed
to
revive
the
residential
construction
industry
.
``
what
sector
is
stepping
forward
to
pick
up
the
slack
?
''
he
asked
.
``
i
draw
a
blank
.
''
by
most
measures
,
the
nation
's
industrial
sector
is
now
growing
very
slowly
--
if
at
all
.
factory
payrolls
fell
in
september
.
so
did
the
federal
reserve
board
's
industrial-production
index
.
yet
many
economists
are
n't
predicting
that
the
economy
is
about
to
slip
into
recession
.
they
cite
a
lack
of
``
imbalances
''
that
provide
early
warning
signals
of
a
downturn
.
inventories
are
closely
watched
for
such
clues
,
for
instance
.
economists
say
a
buildup
in
inventories
can
provoke
cutbacks
in
production
that
can
lead
to
a
recession
.
but
yesterday
's
factory
orders
report
had
good
news
on
that
front
:
it
said
factory
inventories
fell
0.1
%
in
september
,
the
first
decline
since
february
1987
.
``
this
conforms
to
the
`
soft
landing
'
scenario
,
''
said
elliott
platt
,
an
economist
at
donaldson
,
lufkin
&
jenrette
securities
corp
.
``
i
do
n't
see
any
signs
that
inventories
are
excessive
.
''
a
soft
landing
is
an
economic
slowdown
that
eases
inflation
without
leading
to
a
recession
.
the
department
said
orders
for
nondurable
goods
--
those
intended
to
last
fewer
than
three
years
--
fell
0.3
%
in
september
to
$
109.73
billion
after
climbing
0.9
%
the
month
before
.
orders
for
durable
goods
were
up
0.2
%
to
$
127.03
billion
after
rising
3.9
%
the
month
before
.
the
department
previously
estimated
that
durable-goods
orders
fell
0.1
%
in
september
.
factory
shipments
fell
1.6
%
to
$
234.4
billion
after
rising
5.4
%
in
august
.
shipments
have
been
relatively
level
since
january
,
the
commerce
department
noted
.
manufacturers
'
backlogs
of
unfilled
orders
rose
0.5
%
in
september
to
$
497.34
billion
,
helped
by
strength
in
the
defense
capital
goods
sector
.
excluding
these
orders
,
backlogs
declined
0.3
%
.
in
its
construction
spending
report
,
the
commerce
department
said
residential
construction
,
which
accounts
for
nearly
half
of
all
construction
spending
,
was
off
0.9
%
in
september
to
an
annual
rate
of
$
191.9
billion
.
david
berson
,
economist
for
the
mortgage
bankers
association
,
predicted
the
drop
in
interest
rates
eventually
will
boost
spending
on
single-family
homes
,
but
probably
not
until
early
next
year
.
spending
on
private
,
nonresidential
construction
was
off
2.6
%
to
an
annual
rate
of
$
99.1
billion
with
no
sector
showing
strength
.
government
construction
spending
rose
4.3
%
to
$
88
billion
.
after
adjusting
for
inflation
,
the
commerce
department
said
construction
spending
did
n't
change
in
september
.
for
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
,
total
construction
spending
ran
about
2
%
above
last
year
's
level
.
the
government
's
construction
spending
figures
contrast
with
a
report
issued
earlier
in
the
week
by
mcgraw-hill
inc.
's
f.w.
dodge
group
.
dodge
reported
an
8
%
increase
in
construction
contracts
awarded
in
september
.
the
goverment
counts
money
as
it
is
spent
;
dodge
counts
contracts
when
they
are
awarded
.
the
government
includes
money
spent
on
residential
renovation
;
dodge
does
n't
.
although
the
purchasing
managers
'
index
continues
to
indicate
a
slowing
economy
,
it
is
n't
signaling
an
imminent
recession
,
said
robert
bretz
,
chairman
of
the
association
's
survey
committee
and
director
of
materials
management
at
pitney
bowes
inc.
,
stamford
,
conn
.
he
said
the
index
would
have
to
be
in
the
low
40
%
range
for
several
months
to
be
considered
a
forecast
of
recession
.
the
report
offered
new
evidence
that
the
nation
's
export
growth
,
though
still
continuing
,
may
be
slowing
.
only
19
%
of
the
purchasing
managers
reported
better
export
orders
in
october
,
down
from
27
%
in
september
.
and
8
%
said
export
orders
were
down
last
month
,
compared
with
6
%
the
month
before
.
the
purhasing
managers
'
report
also
added
evidence
that
inflation
is
under
control
.
for
the
fifth
consecutive
month
,
purchasing
managers
said
prices
for
the
goods
they
purchased
fell
.
the
decline
was
even
steeper
than
in
september
.
they
also
said
that
vendors
were
delivering
goods
more
quickly
in
october
than
they
had
for
each
of
the
five
previous
months
.
economists
consider
that
a
sign
that
inflationary
pressures
are
abating
.
when
demand
is
stronger
than
suppliers
can
handle
and
delivery
times
lengthen
,
prices
tend
to
rise
.
the
purchasing
managers
'
report
is
based
on
data
provided
by
more
than
250
purchasing
executives
.
each
of
the
survey
's
indicators
gauges
the
difference
between
the
number
of
purchasers
reporting
improvement
in
a
particular
area
and
the
number
reporting
a
worsening
.
for
the
first
time
,
the
october
survey
polled
members
on
imports
.
it
found
that
of
the
73
%
who
import
,
10
%
said
they
imported
more
in
october
and
12
%
said
they
imported
less
than
the
previous
month
.
while
acknowledging
one
month
's
figures
do
n't
prove
a
trend
,
mr.
bretz
said
,
``
it
does
lead
you
to
suspect
imports
are
going
down
,
or
at
least
not
increasing
that
much
.
''
items
listed
as
being
in
short
supply
numbered
only
about
a
dozen
,
but
they
included
one
newcomer
:
milk
and
milk
powder
.
``
it
's
an
odd
thing
to
put
on
the
list
,
''
mr.
bretz
noted
.
he
said
that
for
the
second
month
in
a
row
,
food
processors
reported
a
shortage
of
nonfat
dry
milk
.
they
blamed
increased
demand
for
dairy
products
at
a
time
of
exceptionally
high
u.s.
exports
of
dry
milk
,
coupled
with
very
low
import
quotas

by
gary
katzenstein
is
anything
but
.
it
's
the
petulant
complaint
of
an
impudent
american
whom
sony
hosted
for
a
year
while
he
was
on
a
luce
fellowship
in
tokyo
--
to
the
regret
of
both
parties
.
in
sometimes
amusing
,
more
often
supercilious
,
even
vicious
passages
,
mr.
katzenstein
describes
how
sony
invades
even
the
most
mundane
aspects
of
its
workers
'
lives
--
at
the
regimented
office
,
where
employees
are
assigned
lunch
partners
--
and
at
``
home
''
in
the
austere
company
dormitory
run
by
a
prying
caretaker
.
some
of
his
observations
about
japanese
management
style
are
on
the
mark
.
it
's
probably
true
that
many
salarymen
put
in
unproductive
overtime
just
for
the
sake
of
solidarity
,
that
the
system
is
so
hierarchical
that
only
the
assistant
manager
can
talk
to
the
manager
and
the
manager
to
the
general
manager
,
and
that
sony
was
chary
of
letting
a
young
,
short-term
american
employee
take
on
any
responsibility
.
all
of
this
must
have
been
enormously
frustrating
to
mr.
katzenstein
,
who
went
to
sony
with
degrees
in
business
and
computer
science
and
was
raring
to
invent
another
walkman
.
but
sony
ultimately
took
a
lesson
from
the
american
management
books
and
fired
mr.
katzenstein
,
after
he
committed
the
social
crime
of
making
an
appointment
to
see
the
venerable
akio
morita
,
founder
of
sony
.
it
's
a
shame
their
meeting
never
took
place
.
mr.
katzenstein
certainly
would
have
learned
something
,
and
it
's
even
possible
mr.

would
have

young
woman

owns
her
own

shop

who
lives
in

three
of

suppliers

possibly
help
build
a

build

accounting
for

15

have
speculated
that
the

contribution
could
rise
to
between
20

if

is
the
year
the
negative
ad
,

the

is
that
the

come
of

in
the
three
leading

,
the
negative

have
reached
new
levels
of
hostility
,
raising
fears
that
this
kind
of
mudslinging
,
empty
of

,
is
ushering

``
the

accelerated
with
the
dawn

became
a

mr.

everybody

classic
situation
of

not

mr.

fail
to

his

for
four

but
he
insists
he
voluntarily
admitted
the
``
oversight
''
when
he
was
being
considered
for
a
city
job

he
was
on
the
board
of
an
insurance
company
with
financial
problems

the

's

finance
board
has
refused
to
pay
mr.

$
95comma142
in
matching
funds
because
his

records
are
incomplete

the
campaign
has
blamed
these
reporting
problems
on
computer
errors

and
,
says
mr.

,
he
did
n't
know
the
man
his

get-out-the-vote
effort

been
convicted

kidnapping

,

mr.

he
did

his

did
have
members

mr.
giuliani
's
campaign
chairman
,
peter
powers
,
says
the
dinkins
ad
is
``
deceptive

virginia
:
democratic
lt.
gov.
douglas
wilder
opened
his
gubernatorial
battle
with
republican
marshall
coleman
with
an
abortion
commercial
produced
by
frank
greer
that
analysts
of
every
political
persuasion
agree
was
a
tour
de
force
.
against
a
shot
of
monticello
superimposed
on
an
american
flag
,
an
announcer
talks
about
the
``
strong
tradition
of
freedom
and
individual
liberty
''
that
virginians
have
nurtured
for
generations
.
then
,
just
as
an
image
of
the
statue
of
thomas
jefferson
dissolves
from
the
screen
,
the
announcer
continues
:
``
on
the
issue
of
abortion
,
marshall
coleman
wants
to
take
away
your
right
to
choose
and
give
it
to

politicians
.
''
that
commercial
--
which
said
mr.
coleman
wanted
to
take
away
the
right
of
abortion
``
even
in
cases
of
rape
and
incest
,
''
a
charge
mr.
coleman
denies
--
changed
the
dynamics
of
the
campaign
,
transforming
it
,
at
least
in
part
,
into
a
referendum
on
abortion
.
the
ad
prompted
mr.
coleman
,
the
former
virginia
attorney
general
,
to
launch
a
series
of
advertisements
created
by
bob
goodman
and
designed
to
shake
mr.
wilder
's
support
among
the
very
women
who
were
attracted
by
the
abortion
ad
.
the
coleman
counterattack
featured
a
close-up
of
a
young
woman
in
shadows
and
the
ad
suggested
that
she
was
recalling
an
unpleasant
courtroom
ordeal
.
a
voice
says
,
``
c'mon
,
now
,
do
n't
you
have
boyfriends
?
''
then
an
announcer
interjects
:
``
it
was
douglas
wilder
who
introduced
a
bill
to
force
rape
victims
age
13
and
younger
to
be
interrogated
about
their
private
lives
by
lawyers
for
accused
rapists
.
so
the
next
time
mr.
wilder
talks
about
the
rights
of
women
,
ask
him
about
this
law
he
tried
to
pass
.
''
mr.
wilder
did
introduce
such
legislation
17
years
ago
,
but
he
did
so
at
the
request
of
a
constituent
,
a
common
legislative
technique
used
by
lawmakers
.
the
legislation
itself
noted
that
it
was
introduced
``
by
request
,
''
and
in
1983
mr.
wilder
introduced
a
bill
to
protect
rape
victims
from
unfounded
interrogation
.
``
people
have
grown
tired
of
these
ads
and
coleman
has
gotten
the
stigma
of
being
a
negative
campaigner
,
''
says
mark
rozell
,
a
political
scientist
at
mary
washington
college
.
``
wilder
has
managed
to
get
across
the
idea
that
coleman
will
say
anything
to
get
elected
governor
and
--
more
important
--
has
been
able
to
put
the
onus
for
all
the
negative
campaigning

mr.
coleman
said
this
week
that
he
would
devote
the
remainder
of
the
political
season
to
positive
campaigning
,
but
the
truce
lasted
only
hours
.
by
tuesday
night
,
television
stations
were
carrying
new

mr.

himself

questions
about
mr.

domination

by

,
following
up

''
but
maintaining
u.s.
influence
will
be
difficult
in
the
face
of
japanese
dominance
in
the
region
.
japan
not
only
outstrips
the
u.s.
in
investment
flows

also
outranks
it
in
trade
with
most
southeast
asian
countries
(
although
the
u.s.
remains
the
leading
trade
partner
for
all
of

)
.
moreover
,
the
japanese
government
,
now
the
world
's
largest
aid
donor
,
is
pumping
far
more
assistance
into
the
region
than
the
u.s.
is
.
while
u.s.
officials
voice
optimism
about
japan
's
enlarged
role
in
asia
,
they
also
convey
an
undertone
of
caution
.

there
's
an
understanding

``

some

apprehensive

washington
's
demand
that
tokyo
step
up
its
military
spending
to
ease
the
u.s.
security
burden
in
the
region
.
the
issue
is
further
complicated
by
uncertainty
over
the
future
of
the
u.s.
's
leases
on
military
bases
in
the
philippines
and
by
a
possible
u.s.
troop
reduction
in
south
korea
.
many
asians
regard
a
u.s.
presence
as
a
desirable
counterweight
to
japanese
influence
.
``
no
one
wants
the

had
seen

virtually

the

the
student
was
taking
.
in
fact
,
the
student
had
the
answers
to
almost
all
of
the
40
questions
in
that
section
.
the
student
surrendered
the
notes
,

not
without
a
protest
.
``
my

said
it
was
ok
for

to
use

''
he
said
.
the
teacher
in
question
was
nancy

--
considered
by
many
students
and
parents
to
be
one
of
the
best
at
the
school
.
confronted
,
mrs.
yeargin
admitted
she
had
given
the
questions
and
answers
two
days
before
the
examination
to
two
low-ability
geography
classes
.
she
had
gone
so
far
as
to
display
the
questions
on
an
overhead
projector
and
underline
the
answers
.
mrs.
yeargin
was
fired
and
prosecuted
under
an
unusual
south
carolina
law
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
breach
test
security
.
in
september
,
she
pleaded
guilty
and
paid
a
$
500
fine
.
her
alternative
was
90
days
in
jail
.
her
story
is
partly
one
of
personal
downfall
.
she
was
an
unstinting
teacher
who
won
laurels
and
inspired
students
,
but
she
will
probably
never
teach
again
.
in
her
wake
she
left
the
bitterness
and
anger
of
a
principal
who
was
her
friend
and
now
calls
her
a
betrayer
;
of
colleagues
who
say
she
brought
them
shame
;
of
students
and
parents
who
defended
her
and
insist
she
was
treated
harshly
;
and
of
school-district
officials
stunned
that
despite
the
bald-faced
nature
of
her
actions
,
she
became
something
of
a
local
martyr
.
mrs.
yeargin
's
case
also
casts
some
light
on
the
dark
side
of
school
reform
,
where
pressures
on
teachers
are
growing
and
where
high-stakes
testing
has
enhanced
the
temptation
to
cheat
.
the
1987
statute
mrs.
yeargin
violated
was
designed
to
enforce
provisions
of
south
carolina
's
school-improvement
laws
.
prosecutors
alleged
that
she
was
trying
to
bolster
students
'
scores
to
win
a
bonus
under
the
state
's
1984
education
improvement
act
.
the
bonus
depended
on
her
ability
to
produce
higher
student-test
scores
.
``
there
is
incredible
pressure
on
school
systems
and
teachers
to
raise
test
scores

''
says
walt
haney
,
an
education
professor
and
testing
specialist
at
boston
college
.
``
so
efforts
to
beat
the
tests
are
also
on
the
rise
.
''
and
most
disturbing
,
it
is
educators
,
not
students
,
who
are
blamed
for
much
of
the
wrongdoing

in

by
the
early
1980s
,
its
glory
had
faded

took
over

1986
,
becoming
the
school
's
seventh
principal
in
15
years

her
immediate

suffered
a
nervous
breakdown

his
term
,
a

bled
to
death
in
the

by
a
student

academically
,
mrs.
ward
says
,
the
school
was
having
trouble
serving
in
harmony
its
two
disparate
,
and
evenly
split
,
student
groups
:
a
privileged
white
elite
from
old
monied
neighborhoods
and
blacks
,
many
of
them
poor
,
from
run-down
,
inner
city

.
mrs.
ward
resolved
to
clean
out
``
deadwood
''
in
the
school
's
faculty
and
restore
safety
,
and
she
also
had
some
new
factors
working
in
her
behalf
.
one
was
statewide
school
reform
,
which
raised
overall
educational
funding
and
ushered
in
a
new
public
spirit
for
school
betterment
.
another
was
nancy
yeargin
,
who
came
to
greenville
in
1985
,
full
of
the
energy
and
ambitions
that
reformers
wanted
to
reward
.
``
being
a
teacher
just
became
my
life
,
''
says
the
37-year-old
mrs.
yeargin
,
a
teacher
for
12
years
before
her
dismissal
.
``

loved
the

even
dreamt

''
while
mrs.

fired
and
restructured

and
struggled
to
improve
curriculum
,
mrs.
yeargin
worked
14-hour

,
a
freshman
at
the
university
of
south

had
mrs.

in
the
teacher-cadet
class
last
year

she
says
that
because
of
mrs.
yeargin
she
gave
up
ambitions
in
architecture
and
is
studying
to
become
a
teacher
.
mary
beth
marchand
,
a
greenville
11th
grader
,
also
says
mrs.
yeargin
inspired
her
to
go
into
education
.
``
she
taught
us
more
in
western
civilization
than
i
've
ever
learned
in

''
says
kelli
green
,
a
greenville
senior
.
in
the
classroom
,
students
say
,
mrs.
yeargin
distinguished
herself
by
varying
teaching
approaches
--
forcing
kids
to
pair
up
to
complete
classroom
work
or
using
college-bowl
type
competitions
.
on
weekends
,
she
came
to
work
to
prepare
study
plans
or
sometimes
,
even
to
polish
the
furniture
in
her
classroom
.
``
she
just
never
gave
it
up

mother
.
``
you
'd
see
her
correcting
homework
in
the
stands
at
a
football
game

''
some
fellow
teachers
,
however
,
viewed
mrs.
yeargin
as
cocky
and
too
yielding
to
students
.
mrs.
ward
says
she
often
defended
her
to
colleagues
who
called
her
a
grandstander
.
pressures
began
to
build
.
friends
told
her
she
was
pushing
too
hard
.
because
of
deteriorating
hearing
,
she
told
colleagues
she
feared
she
might
not
be
able
to
teach
much
longer
.
mrs.
yeargin
's
extra
work
was
also
helping
her
earn
points
in
the
state
's
incentive-bonus
program
.
but
the
most
important
source
of
points
was
student
improvement
on
tests
.
huge
gains
by
her
students
in
1987
and
1988
meant
a
total
of
$
5comma000
in
bonuses
over
two
years
--
a
meaningful
addition
to
her
annual
salary
of
$
23comma000
.
winning
a
bonus
for
a
third
year
was
n't
that
important
to
her
,
mrs.
yeargin
insists
.
but
others
at
greenville
high
say
she
was
eager
to
win
--
if
not
for
money
,
then
for
pride
and
recognition
.
mary
elizabeth
ariail
,
another
social-studies
teacher
,
says
she
believed
mrs.
yeargin
wanted
to
keep
her
standing
high
so
she
could
get
a
new
job
that
would
n't
demand
good
hearing
.
indeed
,
mrs.
yeargin
was
interested
in
a
possible
job
with
the
state
teacher
cadet
program
.
last
march
,
after
attending
a
teaching
seminar
in
washington
,
mrs.
yeargin
says
she
returned
to
greenville
two
days
before
annual
testing
feeling
that
she
had
n't
prepared
her
low-ability
geography
students
adequately
.
when
test
booklets
were
passed
out
48
hours
ahead
of
time
,
she
says
she
copied
questions
in
the
social
studies
section
and
gave
the
answers
to
students
.
mrs.
yeargin
admits
she
made
a
big
mistake
but
insists
her
motives
were
correct
.
``
i
was
trying
to
help
kids
in
an
unfair
testing
situation

''
she
says
.
``
only
five

mrs.

says
that
she
also
wanted
to
help
lift
greenville
high
school
's
overall
test
scores
,
usually
near
the
bottom
of
14
district
high
schools
in
rankings
carried
annually
by
local
newspapers
.
mostly
,
she
says
,
she
wanted
to
prevent
the
damage
to
self-esteem
that
her
low-ability
students
would
suffer
from
doing
badly
on
the
test
.
``
these
kids
broke
my
heart
,
''
she
says
.
``
a
whole
day
goes
by
and
no
one
even
knows
they
're
alive
.
they
desperately
needed
somebody
who
showed
they
cared
for
them
,
who
loved
them
.
the
last
thing
they
needed
was
another
drag-down
blow
.
''
school
officials
and
prosecutors
say
mrs.
yeargin
is
lying
.
they
found
students
in
an
advanced
class
a
year
earlier
who
said
she
gave
them
similar
help
,
although
because
the
case
was
n't
tried
in
court
,
this
evidence
was
never
presented
publicly
.
``
that
pretty
much
defeats
any
inkling
that
she
was
out
to
help
the
poor
underprivileged
child
,
''
says
joe
watson
,
the
prosecutor
in
the
case
,
who
is
also
president
of
greenville
high
school
's
alumni
association
.
mrs.
yeargin
concedes
that
she
went
over
the
questions
in
the
earlier
class
,
adding
:
``
i
wanted
to
help
all
''
students
.
mr.
watson
says
mrs.
yeargin
never
complained
to
school
officials
that
the
standardized
test
was
unfair
.
``
do
i
have
much
sympathy
for
her
?
''
mr.
watson
asks
.
``
not
really
.
i
believe
in
the
system
.
i
believe
you
have
to
use
the

to
change

what
she
did
was
like
taking
the
law
into
your
own
hands
.
''
mrs.
ward
says
that
when
the
cheating
was
discovered
,
she
wanted
to
avoid
the
morale-damaging
public
disclosure
that
a
trial
would
bring
.
she
says
she
offered
mrs.
yeargin
a
quiet
resignation
and
thought
she
could
help
save
her
teaching
certificate
.
mrs.
yeargin
declined
.
``
she
said
something
like
`
you
just
want
to
make
it
easy
for
the
school
.
'
i
was
dumbfounded
,
''
mrs.
ward
recalls
.
``
it
was
like
someone
had
turned

knife
in

''
to
the
astonishment
and
dismay
of
her
superiors
and
legal
authorities
--
and
perhaps
as
a
measure
of
the
unpopularity
of
standardized
tests
--
mrs
.
yeargin
won
widespread
local
support
.
the
school-board
hearing
at
which
she
was
dismissed
was
crowded
with
students
,
teachers
and
parents
who
came
to
testify
on
her
behalf
.
supportive
callers
decried
unfair
testing
,
not
mrs.
yeargin
,
on
a
local
radio
talk
show
on
which
she
appeared
.
the
show
did
n't
give
the
particulars
of
mrs.
yeargin
's
offense
,
saying
only
that
she
helped
students
do
better
on
the
test
.
``
the
message
to
the
board
of

out
of
all
this
is
we
've
got
to
take
a
serious
look

how
we

doing

and
our
testing
policies
in
this
state
,
''
said
the
talk-show
host
.
editorials
in
the
greenville
newspaper
allowed
that
mrs.
yeargin
was
wrong
,
but
also
said
the
case
showed
how
testing
was
being
overused
.
the
radio
show
``
enraged
us
,
''
says
mrs.
ward
.
partly
because
of
the
show
,
mr.
watson
says
,
the
district
decided
not
to
recommend
mrs.
yeargin
for
a
first-time
offenders
program
that
could
have
expunged
the
charges
and
the
conviction
from
her
record
.
and
legal
authorities
cranked
up
an
investigation
worthy
of
a
murder
case
.
over
50
witnesses
,
mostly
students
,
were
interviewed
.
at
greenville
high
school
,
meanwhile
,
some
students
--
especially
on
the
cheerleading
squad
--
were
crushed
.
``
it
's
hard
to
explain
to
a
17-year-old
why
someone
they
like

to
go

says
mrs.

.
soon
,
t-shirts
appeared
in
the
corridors
that
carried
the
school
's
familiar
red-and-white
ghs

on
the
front

on
the
back
,
the
shirts
read
,
``

have
all

''
many
colleagues
are
angry
at
mrs.
yeargin
.
``
she
did
a
lot
of
harm
,
''
says
cathryn
rice
,
who
had
discovered
the
crib
notes
.
``
we
work
damn
hard
at
what
we
do
for
damn
little
pay
,
and
what
she
did
cast
unfair
aspersions
on
all
of
us
.
''
but
several
teachers
also
say
the
incident
casts
doubt
on
the
wisdom
of
evaluating
teachers
or
schools
by
using
standardized
test
scores
.
says
gayle
key
,
a
mathematics
teacher
,
``
the

has
opened
up
a
can
of
worms

there
may
be
others
doing
what
she
did

''
mrs.
yeargin
says
she
pleaded
guilty
because
she
realized
it
would
no
longer
be
possible
to
win
reinstatement
,
and
because
she
was
afraid
of
further
charges
.
mrs.
ward
,
for
one
,
was
relieved
.
despite
the
strong
evidence
against
mrs.

,
popular
sentiment
was
so
strong
in
her
favor
,
mrs.

says
,
that
``
i
'm
afraid
a
jury

mr.
kaminski
,
the
schoolteacher
,
and
william
mehrens
,
a
michigan
state
university
education
professor
,
concluded
in
a
study
last
june
that
cat
test
versions
of
scoring
high
and
learning
materials
should
n't
be
used
in
the
classroom
because
of
their
similarity
to
the
actual
test
.
they
devised
a
69-point
scale
--
awarding
one
point
for
each
subskill
measured
on
the
cat
test
--
to
rate
the
closeness
of
test
preparatives
to
the
fifth-grade
cat
.
because
many
of
these
subskills
--
the
symmetry
of
geometrical
figures
,
metric
measurement
of
volume
,
or
pie
and
bar
graphs
,
for
example
--
are
only
a
small
part
of
the
total
fifth-grade
curriculum
,
mr.
kaminski
says
,
the
preparation
kits
would
n't
replicate
too
many
,
if
their
real
intent
was
general
instruction
or
even
general
familiarization
with
test
procedures
.
but
learning
materials
matched
on
66.5
of
69
subskills
.
scoring
high
matched
on
64.5
.
in
cat
sections
where
students
'
knowledge
of
two-letter
consonant
sounds
is
tested
,
the
authors
noted
that
scoring
high
concentrated
on
the
same
sounds
that
the
test
does
--
to
the
exclusion
of
other
sounds
that
fifth
graders
should
know
.
learning
materials
for
the
fifth-grade
contains
at
least
a
dozen
examples
of
exact
matches
or
close
parallels
to
test
items
.
rick
brownell
,
senior
editor
of
scoring

,
says
that
messrs.
kaminski
and
mehrens
are
ignoring
``
the
need
students
have
for
becoming
familiar
with
tests
and

''
he
said
authors
of
scoring

``
scrupulously
avoid

he
does
n't
deny
that
some

in

the
department
of
health
and
human
services
plans
to
extend
its
moratorium
on
federal
funding
of
research
involving
fetal-tissue
transplants
.
medical
researchers
believe
the
transplantation
of
small
amounts
of
fetal
tissue
into
humans
could
help
treat
juvenile
diabetes
and
such
degenerative
diseases
as
alzheimer
's
,
parkinson
's
and
huntington
's
.
but
anti-abortionists
oppose
such
research
because
they
worry
that
the
development
of
therapies
using
fetal-tissue
transplants
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
abortions
.
james
mason
,
assistant
secretary
for
health
,
said
the
ban
on
federal
funding
of
fetal-tissue
transplant
research
``
should
be
continued
indefinitely
.
''
he
said
the
ban
wo
n't
stop
privately
funded
tissue-transplant
research
or
federally
funded
fetal-tissue
research
that
does
n't
involve
transplants
.
department
officials
say
that
hhs
secretary
louis
sullivan
will
support
dr.
mason
's
ruling
,
which
will
be
issued
soon
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
the
acting
director
of
the
national
institutes
of
health
.
both
dr.
mason
and
dr.
sullivan
oppose
federal
funding
for
abortion
,
as
does
president
bush
,
except
in
cases
where
a
woman
's
life
is
threatened
.
the
controversy
began
in
1987
when
the
national
institutes
of
health
,
aware
of
the
policy
implications
of
its
research
,
asked
for
an
hhs
review
of
its
plan
to
implant
fetal
tissue
into
the
brain
of
a
patient
suffering
from
parkinson
's
disease
.
the
department
placed
a
moratorium
on
the
research
,
pending
a
review
of
scientific
,
legal
and
ethical
issues
.
a
majority
of
an
nih-appointed
panel
recommended
late
last
year
that
the
research
continue
under
carefully
controlled
conditions
,
but
the
issue
became
embroiled
in
politics
as
anti-abortion
groups
continued
to
oppose
federal
funding
.
the
dispute
has
hampered
the
administration
's
efforts
to
recruit
prominent
doctors
to
fill
prestigious
posts
at
the
helm
of
the
nih
and
the
centers
for
disease
control
.
several
candidates
have
withdrawn
their
names
from
consideration
after
administration
officials
asked
them
for
their
views
on
abortion
and
fetal-tissue
transplants
.
antonio
novello
,
whom
mr.
bush
nominated
to
serve
as
surgeon
general
,
reportedly
has
assured
the
administration
that
she
opposes
abortion
.
dr.
novello
is
deputy
director
of
the
national
institute
of
child
health
and
human
development
.
some
researchers
have
charged
that
the
administration
is
imposing
new
ideological
tests
for
top
scientific
posts
.
earlier
this
week
,
dr.
sullivan
tried
to
defuse
these
charges
by
stressing
that
candidates
to
head
the
nih
and
the
cdc
will
be
judged
by
``
standards
of
scientific
and
administrative
excellence
,
''
not
politics
.
but
the
administration
's
handling
of
the
fetal-tissue
transplant
issue
disturbs
many
scientists
.
``
when
scientific
progress
moves
into
uncharted
ground
,
there
has
to
be
a
role
for
society
to
make
judgments
about
its
applications
,
''
says
myron
genel
,
associate
dean
of
the
yale
medical
school
.
``
the
disturbing
thing
about
this
abortion
issue
is
that
the
debate
has
become
polarized
,
so
that
no
mechanism
exists
''
for
finding
a
middle
ground
.
yale
is
one
of
the
few
medical
institutions
conducting
privately
funded
research
on
fetal-tissue
transplants
.
but
dr.
genel
warns
that
dr.
mason
's
ruling
may
discourage
private
funding
.
``
the
unavailability
of
federal
funds
,
and
the
climate
in
which
the
decision
was
made
,
certainly
do
n't
provide
any
incentive
for
one
of
the
more
visible
foundations
to
provide
support
,
''
he
said
.
despite
the
flap
over
transplants
,
federal
funding
of
research
involving
fetal
tissues
will
continue
on
a
number
of
fronts
.
``
such
research
may
ultimately
result
in
the
ability
to
regenerate
damaged
tissues
or
to
turn
off
genes
that
cause
cancer
''
or
to
regulate
genes
that
cause
down
's
syndrome
,
the
leading
cause
of
mental
retardation
,
according
to
an
nih
summary
.
the
nih
currently
spends
about
$
8
million
annually
on
fetal-tissue
research
out
of
a
total
research

the
warnings
,
issued
to
at
least
100
criminal
defense
attorneys
in
several
major
cities
in
the
last
week
,
have
led
to
an
outcry
by
members
of
the
organized
bar
,
who
claim
the
information
is
protected
by
attorney-client
privilege
.
the
irs
warnings
stem
from
a
1984
law
that
requires
anyone
who
receives
more
than
$
10comma000
in
cash
from
a
client
or
customer
in
one
or
more
related
transactions
``
in
the
course
of
trade
or
business
''
to
report
the
payment
on
a
document
known
as
form
8300
.
the
form
asks
for
such
details
as
the
client
's
name
,
social
security
number
,
passport
number
and
details
about
the
services
provided
for
the
payment
.
failure
to
complete
the
form
had
been
punishable
as
a
misdemeanor
until
last
november
,
when
congress
determined
that
the
crime
was
a
felony
punishable
by
up
to
10
years
in
prison
.
attorneys
have
argued
since
1985
,
when
the
law
took
effect
,
that
they
can
not
provide
information
about
clients
who
do
n't
wish
their
identities
to
be
known
.
many
attorneys
have
returned
incomplete
forms
to
the
irs
in
recent
years
,
citing
attorney-client
privilege
.
until
last
week
,
the
irs
rarely
acted
on
the
incomplete
forms
.
``
this
form
forces
a
lawyer
to
become
,
in
effect
,
a
witness
against
his
client
,
''
said
neal
r.
sonnett
,
president
of
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers
.
``
the
irs
is
asking
lawyers
to
red-flag
a
criminal
problem
to
the
government
,
''
added
mr.
sonnett
,
a
miami
lawyer
who
has
heard
from
dozens
of
attorneys
who
received
letters
in
recent
days
and
has
himself
received
the
computer-generated
irs
forms
sent
by
certified
mail
.
mr.
sonnett
said
that
clients
who
pay
cash
may
include
alleged
drug
dealers
who
do
n't
have
domestic
bank
accounts
.
these
individuals
may
not
necessarily
be
under
investigation
when
they
hire
lawyers
.
mr.
sonnett
said
there
also
may
be
other
circumstances
under
which
individuals
would
n't
want
the
government
to
know
they
had
retained
criminal
defense
lawyers
.
filling
out
detailed
forms
about
these
individuals
would
tip
the
irs
off
and
spark
action
against
the
clients
,
he
said
.

'
group
formed
a
task
force

deal
with

matter
.

delegates
passed

resolution
in

condemning
the
irs
reporting
requirement
.
michael
ross
,
a
new
york
lawyer
who
heads
the
aba
's
grand
jury
committee
,
said
that
lawyers
are
prohibited
by
the
aba
's
code
of
ethics
from
disclosing
information
about
a
client
except
where
a
court
orders
it
or
to
prevent
the
client
from
committing
a
criminal
act
that
could
result
in
death
.
mr.
ross
said
he
met
with
officials
of
the
irs
and
the
justice
department
,
which
would
bring
any
enforcement
actions
against
taxpayers
,
to
discuss
the
issue
last
may
.
at
that
meeting
,
he
said
,
the
justice
department
assured
him
that
enforcement
procedures
would
n't
be
threatened
against
attorneys
without
further
review
and
advance
notice
.
mr.
ross
said
irs
officials
opposed
the
justice
department
's
moderate
stance
on
the
matter
.
but
in
the
letters
sent
in
recent
days
,
christopher
j.
lezovich
of
the
irs
computing
center
in
detroit
,
told
attorneys
that
``
failing
to
voluntarily
submit
the
requested
information
could
result
in
summons
enforcement
action
being
initiated
.
''
in
some
cases
,
the
irs
asked
for
information
dating
back
to
forms
it
received
in
1985
.
a
spokesman
for
the
irs
confirmed
that
``
there
has
been
correspondence
mailed
about
incomplete
8300s
,
''
but
he
declined
to
say
why
the
letters
were
sent
to
lawyers
now
.
individuals
familiar
with
the
justice
department
's
policy
said
that
justice
officials
had
n't
any
knowledge
of
the
irs
's
actions
in
the
last
week
.
lawyers
worry
that
if
they
provide
information
about
clients
,
that
data
could
quickly
end
up
in
the
hands
of
prosecutors
.
prosecutors
need
court
permission
to
obtain
the
tax
returns
of
an
individual
or
a
business
.
but
they
have
obtained
8300
forms
without
court
permission
and
used
the
information
to
help
develop
criminal
cases
.
some
criminal
lawyers
speculated
that
the
irs
was
sending
the
letters
to
test
the
issue
.
in
a
number
of
recent

federal
courts

recognize

him

mr.

fujitsu

's
top
executive
took
the
unusual
step
of
publicly
apologizing
for
his
company
's
making
bids
of
just
one
yen
for
several
local
government
projects
,
while
computer
rival
nec
corp.
made
a
written
apology
for
indulging
in
the

practice

meanwhile
,
business

rebuked
the
computer
makers
,
and
fretted
about
the
broader
statement
the
companies

actions
make
about
japanese
cutthroat
pricing
.
fujitsu
said
it
bid
the
equivalent
of
less
than
a
u.s.
penny
on
three
separate
municipal
contracts
during
the
past
two
years
.
the
company
also
disclosed
that
during
that
period
it
offered
10comma000
yen
,
or
about
$
70
,
for
another
contract
.
but

computer
maker
,
is

alone
.
nec
,
one
of
its
largest
domestic
competitors
,
said
it
bid
one
yen
in
two
separate
public
auctions
since
1987
.
in
both
cases
,
nec
lost
the
contract
to
fujitsu
,
which
made
the
same
bid
and
won
a
tie-breaking
lottery
.
all
the
contracts
were
for
computer-system-design
contracts
and
involved
no
hardware
or
software
.
the
ministry
of
international
trade
and
industry
summoned
executives
from
the
companies
to
``
make
sure
they
understood
''
the
concern
about
such
practices
,
according
to
a
government
spokesman
.
``
these
cases
lead
to
the
loss
of
the
firms

social
and

credibility

''
a

statement
said
.
japan
's
fair
trade
commission
has
said
it
is
considering
investigating
the
bids
for
possible
antitrust-law
violations
.
``
we
would
like
to
apologize
for
having
caused
huge
trouble

''
fujitsu
president
takuma
yamamoto
,
read
from
a
prepared
statement
as
he
stood
before
a
packed
news
conference
at
his
company
's
downtown
headquarters
.
the
bids
,
he
added
,
were
``
contrary
to
common
sense
.
''
nec
released
a
statement
saying
,
``
we
feel
sorry
for
having
caused
trouble
to
society
,
''
a
form
of
apology
common
in
japan
for
companies
caught
in
embarrassing
situations
.
japanese
companies
have
long
had
a
reputation
for
sacrificing
short-term
profits
to
make
a
sale
that
may
have
long-term
benefits
.
but
the
growing
controversy
comes
as
many
practices
historically
accepted
as
normal
here
--
such
as
politicians
accepting
substantial
gifts
from
businessmen
or
having
extramarital
affairs
--
are
coming
under
close
ethical
scrutiny
.
the
fire
is
also
fueled
by
growing
international
interest
in
japanese
behavior
.
so
far
there
have
been
no
public
overseas
complaints
about
the
issue
.
but
in
one
of
the
auctions
in
question
,
international
business
machines
corp.
made
a
bid
substantially
higher
than
the
fujitsu
offer
,
according
to
the
municipality
.
the
low-ball
bids
touch
on
issues
central
to
the
increasingly
tense
trade
debate
.
foreigners
complain
that
they
have
limited
access
to
government
procurement
in
japan
,
in
part
because
japanese
companies
unfairly
undercut
them
.
the
u.s.
government
in
recent
years
has
accused
japanese
companies
of
excessively
slashing
prices
on
semiconductors
and
supercomputers
--
products
fujitsu
and
nec
make
.
asked
whether
the
bidding
flap
would
hurt
u.s.-japan
relations
,
mr.
yamamoto
said
,
``
this
will
be
a
minus
factor
.
''
the
``
one-yen
''
controversy
first
came
to
a
head
last
week
when
the
city
of
hiroshima
announced
that
fujitsu
won
a
contract
to
design
a
computer
system
to
map
its
waterworks
.
the
city
had
expected
to
pay
about
11
million
yen
(
$
77comma000
)
,
but
fujitsu
essentially
offered
to
do
it
for
free
.
then
wednesday
,
fujitsu
said
it
made
a
similar
bid
to
win
a
library
contract
in
nagano
prefecture
two
weeks
earlier
.
it
also
said
that
in
july
,
it
bid
10comma000
yen
to
design
a
system
for
the
saitama
prefectural
library
,
and
two
years
ago
,
it
bid
one
yen
to
plan
the
telecommunications
system
for
wakayama
prefecture
.
the
company
said
it
has
offered
to
withdraw
its
bids
in
hiroshima
and
nagano
.
the
municipalities
said
they
have
n't
decided
whether
to
try
to
force
the
company
to
go
through
with
the
contracts
.
fujitsu
and
nec
said
they
were
still
investigating
,
and
that
knowledge
of
more
such
bids
could
emerge
.
mr.
yamamoto
insisted
that
headquarters
had
n't
approved
the
bids
,
and
that
he
did
n't
know
about
most
of
the
cases
until
wednesday
.
other
major
japanese
computer
companies

yesterday
said
they
have
never

the

``

,
dealers
said
the

has

douglas

corporate

with

traced
the
dollar
's
recent
solid
performance
against
the
yen
to
purchases
of
securities
by
japanese
insurance
companies
and
trust
banks
and
the
sense
that
another
wave
of
investment
is
waiting
in
the
wings

he
contends
that
the
perception
in

of
a
vitriolic
u.s.
response
to
sony

's
announcement
of
its
purchase
of

the

forthcoming
maturity
in
november
of
a
10-year
japanese
government
yen-denominated

issue
valued
at

has
prompted
speculation
in
the
market
that
investors
redeeming
the
bonds
will
diversify
into
dollar-denominated
instruments
,
according
to
mr.
madison
.
it
remains
unclear
whether
the
bond
issue
will
be
rolled
over
.
meanwhile
,
traders
in
tokyo
say
that
the
prospect
of
lower
u.s.
interest
rates
has
spurred
dollar
buying
by
japanese
institutions
.
they
point
out
that
these
institutions
want
to
lock
in
returns
on
high-yield
u.s.
treasury
debt
and
suggest
demand
for
the
u.s.
unit
will
continue
unabated
until

recede

again

have

some
of

stations
that
bought
``

reruns
for
record
prices
two
years
ago
are
n't
laughing
much
these
days

the
reruns
have
helped
ratings
at
many
of
the
187
network
affiliates
and
independent
tv
stations
that
air
the
shows
.
but
the
ratings
are
considerably
below
expectations
,
and
some
stations
say
they
may
not
buy
new
episodes
when
their
current
contracts
expire
.
meanwhile
,
stations
are
fuming
because
,
many
of
them
say
,
the
show
's
distributor
,
viacom
inc.
,
is
giving
an
ultimatum
:
either
sign
new
long-term
commitments
to
buy
future
episodes
or
risk
losing
``
cosby
''
to
a
competitor

trying
to

to
make
commitments
to

one
station
manager
says
he
believes
viacom

move
is
a
``
pre-emptive
strike

the
company
is
worried
that

continue
to
drop
in

,
how
much

mr.

speculated
that
the
leeway

a

for

estimated
that

sales
materialize
--
would
result
in

receiving
only
$
36
to
$
45
a

in
cash
.
the
lower
figures
,
the
spokesman
said
,
would
stem
from
preferred
shares
being
converted

and
the
possibility
that

'
subsidiaries
might
be
required
to
place
their

in

added
that

explains

signs
of
a
slowing
economy
are
increasing
pressure
on
the
federal
reserve
to
cut
short-term
interest
rates
,
but
it
is
n't
clear
whether
the
central
bank
will
do
so
.
a
survey
by
the
fed
's
12
district
banks
shows
economic
growth
has
been
sluggish
in
recent
weeks
,
while
upward
pressures
on
prices
have
moderated
.
``
the
economy
is
clearly
slowing
,
''
says
robert
black
,
president
of
the
richmond
federal
reserve
bank
.
``
if
you
look
at
the
third
quarter
as
posting
roughly
2.5
%
growth
,
i
do
see
some
slowing
in
the
fourth
quarter
,
''
agrees
kansas
city
fed
president
roger
guffey
.
nevertheless
,
both
mr.
guffey
and
mr.
black
say
the
slowdown
so
far
is
no
cause
for
concern
.
``
we
're
coming
closer
to
achieving
the
stated
objective
of
slowing
the
economy
to
a
point
where
hopefully
some
downward
trend
in
prices
will
occur
,
''
said
mr.
guffey
.
bush
administration
officials
are
looking
to
the
fed
to
bring
down
rates
,
and
financial
markets
seem
to
be
expecting
easier
credit
as
well
.
``
i
think
the
market
had
been
expecting
the
fed
to
ease
sooner
and
a
little
more
than
it
has
to
date
,

the

rate
by
about

point
to
8.75
%
after
the
oct.

stock
market
plunge
,
but
has
shown
no
sign
of
movement
since
.
the
report
from
the
fed
found
that
manufacturing
,
in
particular
,
has
been
weak
in
recent
weeks
.
the
philadelphia
fed
,
for
instance
,
reported
that
manufacturing
activity
``
continues
to
decline
''
for
the
fourth
month
in
a
row
.
and
in
the
chicago
district
,
the
report
said
,
``
a
manufacturer
of
capital
goods
noted
slower
orders
for
some
types
,
including
defense
equipment
,
petroleum
equipment
,
food
packaging
machinery
and
material
handling
equipment
.
''
retail
sales
also
were
reported
slow
in
most
districts
,
particularly
``
for
discretionary
,
big-ticket
items
such
as
furniture
,
home
appliances
and
consumer
electronics
.
''
and
construction
also
was
described
as
slow
in
most
areas
.
despite
the
economic
slowdown
,
there
are
few
clear
signs
that
growth
is
coming
to
a
halt
.
as
a
result
,
fed
officials
may
be
divided
over
whether
to
ease
credit
.
several
fed
governors
in
washington
have
been
pushing
for
easier
credit
;
but
many
of
the
regional
fed
presidents
have
been
resisting
such
a
move
.
mr.
black
said
he
is
``
pleased
''
with
the
economy
's
recent
performance
,
and
does
n't
see
``
a
lot
of
excesses
out
there
that
would
tilt
us
into
recession
.
''
``
there
is
always
a
chance
of
recession
,
''
added
mr.
guffey
,
``
but
if
you
ask
me
to
put
a
percentage
on
it
,
i
would
think
it
's
well

said
nl
and

cut
the

they

they
initially
planned

substantial

finance

also
said

reduced
its

was

allowed
to
see

criticism
in
the
u.s.
over
recent
japanese
acquisitions
is
looming
ever
larger
in
the
two
countries
'
relations
.
officials
from
both
nations
say
the
u.s.
public
's
skittishness
about
japanese
investment
could
color
a
second
round
of
bilateral
economic
talks
scheduled
for
next
week
in
washington
.
not
that
washington
and
tokyo
disagree
on
the
japanese
acquisitions
;
indeed
,
each
has
come
out
in
favor
of
unfettered
investment
in
the
u.s.
.
where
they
disagree
is
on
the
subject
of
u.s.
direct
investment
in
japan
.
the
u.s.
wants
the
removal
of
what
it
perceives
as
barriers
to
investment
;
japan
denies
there
are
real
barriers
.
the
heated
talk
stirred
up
by
recent
japanese
investments
in
the
u.s.
is
focusing
attention
on
the
differences
in
investment
climate
,
even
though
it
's
only
one
of
many
subjects
to
be
covered
in
the
bilateral
talks
,
known
as
the
structural
impediments
initiative
.
the
japanese
``
should
see
this
rhetoric
as
a
signal
of
the
need
for
a
change
in
their
own
economy
,
''
says
charles
dallara
,
u.s.
assistant
treasury
secretary
,
who
has
been
in
tokyo
this
week
informally
discussing
the
impending
negotiations
with
government
and
business
leaders
.
``
we
have
a
long
history
of
maintaining
an
open
direct-investment
policy
,
''
mr.
dallara
says
.
``
u.s.
investors
should
have
a
greater
opportunity
at
direct
investment
''
in
japan
.
the
japanese
fret
openly
about
the
u.s.
public
's
rancor
.
one
clear
sign
of
japan
's
nervousness
came
this
week
,
when
a
spokesman
for
japan
's
foreign
ministry
devoted
nearly
all
of
a
regular
,
half-hour
briefing
for
foreign
journalists
to
the
subject
of
recent
japanese
investments
in
the
u.s.
.
``
we
believe
that
it
is
vitally
important
for
those
japanese
business
interests
{
in
the
u.s.
.
}
to
be
more
aware
of
the
emotions
and
concerns
of
the
american
people
,
''
said
the
spokesman
,
taizo
watanabe
.
at
the
same
time
,
though
,
he
chastised
the
media
for
paying
such
close
attention
to
japanese
investment
when
other
foreign
countries
,
notably
britain
,
are
acquiring
more
american
assets
.
fears
that
japanese
investors
are
buying
up
america
have
escalated
sharply
in
the
past
several
weeks
,
with
sony
corp.
's
purchase
of
columbia
pictures
entertainment
inc.
from
coca-cola
co.
and
mitsubishi
estate
co.
's
acquisition
of
a
51
%
holding
in
rockefeller
group
,
the
owner
of
some
of
midtown
manhattan
's
most
exclusive
real
estate
.
even
before
those
moves
added
fuel
,
the
fires
of
discontent
had
been
well
stoked
by
the
highly
publicized
experience
in
japan
of
one
u.s.
investor
,
t.
boone
pickens
jr
.
the
texas
oilman
has
acquired
a
26.2
%
stake
valued
at
more
than
$
1.2
billion
in
an
automotive-lighting
company
,
koito
manufacturing
co
.
but
he
has
failed
to
gain
any
influence
at
the
company
.
koito
has
refused
to
grant
mr.
pickens
seats
on
its
board
,
asserting
he
is
a
greenmailer
trying
to
pressure
koito
's
other
shareholders
into
buying
him
out
at
a
profit
.
mr.
pickens
made
considerable
political
hay
with
his
troubles
in
japan
.
the
senate
finance
committee
,
chaired
by
a
fellow
texan
,
democratic
sen.
lloyd
bentsen
,
last
month
urged
u.s.
trade
representative
carla
hills
to
use
mr.
pickens
's
experience
in
talks
with
tokyo
``
to
highlight
this
problem
facing
americans
who
seek
access
to
the
japanese
capital
markets
.
''
while
mr.
dallara
and
japanese
officials
say
the
question
of
investors
'
access
to
the
u.s.
and
japanese
markets
may
get
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
public
's
attention
,
a
number
of
other
important
economic
issues
will
be
on
the
table
at
next
week
's
talks
.
among
them
are
differences
in
savings
and
investment
rates
,
corporate
structures
and
management
,
and
government
spending
.
each
side
has
a
litany
of
recommendations
for
the
other
.
the
u.s.
says
it
is
anxious
for
results
.
``
we
feel
very
strongly
that
we
really
need
action
across
the
full
range
of
issues
we
've
identified
,
and
we
need
it
by
next
spring
,
''
mr.
dallara
says
.
both
sides
have
agreed
that
the
talks
will
be
most
successful
if
negotiators
start
by
focusing
on
the
areas
that
can
be
most
easily
changed
.
but
they
have
n't
clarified
what
those
might
be
.
after
the
first
set
of
meetings
two
months
ago
,
some
u.s.
officials
complained
that
japan
had
n't
come
up
with
specific
changes
it
was
prepared
to
make
.
the
japanese
retort
that
the
first
round
was
too
early
to
make
concessions
.
``
just
to
say
the
distribution
system
is
wrong
does
n't
mean
anything
,
''
says
a
ministry
of
international
trade
and
industry
official
.
``
we
need
to
clarify
what
exactly
is
wrong
with
it
.
''
that
process
of
sorting
out
specifics
is
likely
to
take
time
,
the
japanese
say
,
no
matter
how
badly
the
u.s.
wants
quick
results
.
for
instance
,
at
the
first
meeting
the
two
sides
could
n't
even
agree
on
basic
data
used
in
price
discussions
.
since
then
,
a
team
of
about
15
miti
and
u.s.
commerce
department
officials
have
crossed
the
globe
gauging
consumer
prices
.
by
monday
,
they
hope
to
have
a
sheaf
of
documents
both
sides
can
trust
.
``
little
by
little
,
there
is
progress
,
''
says
the
miti
official
.
``
both
sides
are
taking
action

banks
have
tried
packaging
before
.
in
1973
,
wells
fargo

co.
of
san
francisco
launched
the
gold
account
,
which
included
free
checking
,
a
credit
card
,
safe-deposit
box
and
travelers
checks
for
a
$
3
monthly
fee
.
the
concept
begot
a
slew
of
copycats
,
but
the
banks
stopped
promoting
the
packages
.
one
big
reason
:
thin
margins
.
many
banks
,
particularly
smaller
ones
,
were
slow
to
computerize
and
could
n't
target
market
niches
that
would
have
made
the
programs
more
profitable
.
as
banks
'
earnings
were
squeezed
in
the
mid-1970s
,
the
emphasis
switched
to
finding
ways
to
cut
costs
.
but
now
computers
are
enabling
more
banks
to
analyze
their
customers
by
age
,
income
and
geography
.
they
are
better
able
to
get
to
those
segments
in
the
wake
of
the
deregulation
that
began
in
the
late
1970s
.
deregulation
has
effectively
removed
all
restrictions
on
what
banks
can
pay
for
deposits
,
as
well
as
opened
up
the
field
for
new
products
such
as
high-rate
cds
.
where
a
bank
once
offered
a
standard
passbook
savings
account
,
it
began
offering
money-market
accounts
,
certificates
of
deposit
and
interest-bearing
checking
,
and
staggering
rates
based
on
the
size
of
deposits
.
the
competition
has
grown
more
intense
as
bigger
banks
such
as
norwest
corp.
of
minneapolis
and
chemical
banking
corp.
of
new
york
extend
their
market-share
battles
into
small
towns
across
the
nation
.
``
today
,
a
banker
is
worrying
about
local
,
regional
and
money-center
{
banks
}
,
as
well
as
thrifts
and
credit
unions
,
''
says
ms.
moore
at
synergistics
research
.
``
so
people
who
were
n't
even
thinking
about
targeting
10
years
ago
are
scrambling
to
define
their
customer
base
.
''
the
competition
has
cultivated
a
much
savvier
consumer
.
``
the
average
household
will
spread
19
accounts
over
a
dozen
financial
institutions

''
says
michael
p.
sullivan
,
who
runs
his
own
bank
consulting
firm
in
charlotte
,
n.c
.
``
this
much
fragmentation
makes
attracting
and
keeping
today
's
rate-sensitive
customers
costly
.
''
packages
encourage
loyalty
by
rewarding
customers
for
doing
the
bulk
of
their
banking
in
one
place
.
for
their
troubles
,
the
banks
get
a
larger
captive
audience
that
is
less
likely
to
move
at
the
drop
of
a
rate
.
the
more
accounts
customers
have
,
mr.
sullivan
says
,
the
more
likely
they
are
to
be
attracted
to
a
package
--
and
to
be
loyal
to
the
bank
that
offers
it
.
that
can
pay
off
down
the
road
as
customers
,
especially
the
younger
ones
,
change
from
borrowers
to
savers\/investors
.
packaging
has
some
drawbacks
.
the
additional
technology
,
personnel
training
and
promotional
effort
can
be
expensive

``
it
's
not

to
roll
out

comprehensive
,

,
''
mr.
jacob
says
.
still
,
bankers
expect
packaging
to
flourish
,
primarily
because
more
customers
are
demanding
that
financial
services
be
tailored
to
their
needs

that

would
support

commission
halts
of
program
trading
during
market
emergencies
.
but
the
new
york
stock
exchange
chairman
said
he
does
n't
support
reinstating
a
``
collar
''
on
program
trading
,
arguing
that
firms
could
get
around
such
a
limit
.
the
chicago
merc
said
a

one-hour
price
limit
would
take
effect
in
its
standard

poor

fell
20

points
--
the
equivalent
of
about
a
150-point
drop
in
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
.
if
the
20-point
limit
is
triggered
after
1:30
p.m

chicago
time
,
it
would
remain
in
effect
until
the
normal
close
of
trading
at
3:15
p.m

with
the
limit
in
effect
,
members
would
be
able
to
execute
trades
at
the
limit
price
or
at
higher
prices
,
but
not
below
it
.
the
exchange
said
it
decided
a
new
circuit
breaker
was
needed
following
a
review
of
the
tumultuous
trading
in
stocks
and
stock-index
futures
on
friday
oct.
13
,
when
the
dow
jones
industrials
plunged
190
points
and
stock-index
futures
prices
skidded
as
well
.
late
that
afternoon
the
s&p
500
stock-index
futures
contract
fell
a
total
of
30
index
points
,
hitting
a
merc
circuit
breaker
limit
that
remained
in
effect
for
the
rest
of
the
trading
session
.
the
merc
said
that
its
existing
30-minute
,
12-point
limit
on
s&p
500
stock-index
futures
trading
(
equal
to
about
100
points
on
the
dow
jones
industrials
)
,
which
was
triggered
oct.
13
,
will
remain
in
effect
.
leo
melamed
,
merc
executive
committee
chairman
,
said
that
the
12-point
limit
appeared
to
lessen
the
selling
panic
oct.
13
.
but
when
the
contract
reopened
,
the
subsequent
flood
of
sell
orders
that
quickly
knocked
the
contract
down
to
the
30-point
limit
indicated
that
the
intermediate
limit
of
20
points
was
needed
to
help
keep
stock
and
stock-index
futures
prices
synchronized
.
several
traders
maintained
that
the
merc
's
12-point
circuit-breaker
aggravated
the
market
slide
oct.
13
by
directing
additional
selling
pressure
to
the
floor
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
.
all
of
the
changes
require
regulatory
approval
,
which
is
expected
shortly
.
the
exchange
also
said
that
the
30-point
circuit
breaker
,
which
currently
provides
only
a
one-hour
respite
during
market
sell-offs
,
will
become
the
maximum
one-day
limit
for
the
s&p
500
stock-index
futures
contract
;
the
one-day
limit
now
is
50
index
points
.
a
final
modification
was
made
to
the
five-point
opening
limit
for
the
contract
.
the
merc
said
that
five-point
limit
will
remain
in
effect
for
the
first
10
minutes
of
trading
.
the
limit
lapses
under
current
exchange
rules
if
contracts
trade
above
the
limit
price
during
the
opening
10
minutes
of

at

said
the

that
response
annoyed

snapped

about

mr.

worries
that
old
age
and
the
flightiness
of
youth
will
diminish
the
ranks
of
the
east
anglian
group
that
keeps
the
aslacton
bells
pealing
.
history
,
after
all
,
is
not
on
his
side
.
according
to
a
nationwide
survey
taken
a
year
ago
,
nearly
a
third
of
england
's
church
bells
are
no
longer
rung
on
sundays
because
there
is
no
one
to
ring
them
.
it
is
easy
to
see
why
the
ancient
art
is
on
the
ropes
.
the
less
complicated
version
of
playing
tunes
on
bells
,
as
do
the
carillons
of
continental
europe
,
is
considered
by
the
english
to
be
childish
,
fit
only
for
foreigners
.
change-ringing
,
a
mind-boggling
exercise
the
english
invented
380
years
ago
,
requires
physical
dexterity
--
some
bells
weigh
more
than
a
ton
--
combined
with
intense
mental
concentration
.
proper
english
bells
are
started
off
in
``
rounds
,
''
from
the
highest-pitched
bell
to
the
lowest
--
a
simple
descending
scale
using
,
in
larger
churches
,
as
many
as
12
bells
.
then
,
at
a
signal
,
the
ringers
begin
varying
the
order
in
which
the
bells
sound
without
altering
the
steady
rhythm
of
the
striking
.
each
variation
,
or
change
,
can
occur
only
once
,
the
rules
state
.
ringers
memorize
patterns
of
changes
,
known
as
``
methods
,
''
which
have
odd-sounding
names
like
kent
treble
bob
major
or
grandsire
caters
.
a
series
of
5comma000
or
so
changes
is
a
``
peal
''
and
takes
about
three
hours
.
a
look
at
a
thursday
night
practice
at
st.
mary
abbot
church
in
the
kensington
district
of
london
gives
an
idea
of
the
work
involved
.
ten
shirt-sleeved
ringers
stand
in
a
circle
,
one
foot
ahead
of
the
other
in
a
prize-fighter
's
stance
,
each
pulling
a
rope
that
disappears
through
a
small
hole
in
the
high
ceiling
of
the
ringing
chamber
.
no
one
speaks
,
and
the
snaking
of
the
ropes
seems
to
make
as
much
sound
as
the
bells
themselves
,
muffled
by
the
ceiling
.
totally
absorbed
,
the
ringers
stare
straight
ahead
,
using
peripheral
vision
(
they
call
it
``
rope-sight
''
)
to
watch
the
other
ropes
and
thus
time
their
pulls
.
far
above
in
the
belfry
,
the
huge
bronze
bells
,
mounted
on
wheels
,
swing
madly
through
a
full
360
degrees
,
starting
and
ending
,
surprisingly
,
in
the
inverted
,
or
mouth-up
position
.
skilled
ringers
use
their
wrists
to
advance
or
retard
the
next
swing
,
so
that
one
bell
can
swap
places
with
another
in
the
following
change
.
in
a
well-known
detective-story
involving
church
bells
,
english
novelist
dorothy
l.
sayers
described
ringing
as
a
``
passion
{
that
}
finds
its
satisfaction
in
mathematical
completeness
and
mechanical
perfection
.
''
ringers
,
she
added
,
are
``
filled
with
the
solemn
intoxication
that
comes
of
intricate
ritual
faultlessly
performed
.
''
``
ringing
does
become
a
bit
of
an
obsession
,
''
admits
stephanie
pattenden
,
master
of
the
band
at
st.
mary
abbot
and
one
of
england
's
best
female
ringers
.
it
is
a
passion
that
usually
stays
in
the
tower
,
however
.
more
often
than
not
,
ringers
think
of
the
church
as
something
stuck
on
the
bottom
of
the
belfry
.
when
their
changes
are
completed
,
and
after
they
have
worked
up
a
sweat
,
ringers
often
skip
off
to
the
local
pub
,
leaving
worship
for
others
below
.
this
does
not
sit
well
with
some
clerics
.
with
membership
of
the
church
of
england
steadily
dwindling
,
strong-willed
vicars
are
pressing
equally
strong-willed
and
often
non-religious
ringers
to
attend
services
.
two
years
ago
,
the
rev.
jeremy
hummerstone
,
vicar
of
great
torrington
,
devon
,
got
so
fed
up
with
ringers
who
did
n't
attend
service
he
sacked
the
entire
band
;
the
ringers
promptly
set
up
a
picket
line
in
protest
.
``
they
were
a
self-perpetuating
club
that
treated
the
tower
as
sort
of
a
separate
premises
,
''
the
vicar
hummerstone
says
.
an
entirely
new
band
rings
today
at
great
torrington
,
several
of
whom
are
members
of
the
congregation
.
but
there
still
are
n't
enough
ringers
to
ring
more
than
six
of
the
eight
bells
.
at
st.
mary
's
church
in
ilminster
,
somerset
,
the
bells
have
fallen
silent
following
a
dust-up
over
church
attendance
.
the
vicar
,
w.d.
jones
,
refuses
to
talk
about
it
,
saying
it
would
``
reopen
the
wound
.
''
but
c.j.b.
marshall
,
vicar
of
a
nearby
church
,
feels
the
fault
is
in
the
stairs
from
the
bell
tower
that
are
located
next
to
the
altar
.
``
so
crunch
,
crunch
,
crunch
,
bang
,
bang
,
bang
--
here
come
the
ringers
from
above
,
making
a
very
obvious
exit
while
the
congregation
is
at
prayer
,
''
he
says
.
vicar
marshall
admits
to
mixed
feelings
about
this
issue
,
since
he
is
both
a
vicar
and
an
active
bell-ringer
himself
.
``
the
sound
of
bells
is
a
net
to
draw
people
into
the
church
,
''
he
says
.
``
i
live
in
hopes
that
the
ringers
themselves
will
be
drawn
into
that
fuller
life
.
''
the
central
council
of
church
bell
ringers
,
a
sort
of
parliament
of
ringing
groups
,
aims
to
improve
relations
with
vicars
,
says
john
c.
baldwin
,
president
.
it
hopes
to
speak
to
students
at
theological
colleges
about
the
joys
of
bell
ringing
and
will
shortly
publish
a
booklet
for
every
vicar
in
the
country
entitled
,
``
the
bells
in
your
care
.
''
says
mr.
baldwin
,
``
we
recognize
that
we
may
no
longer
have
as
high
a
priority
in
church
life
and
experience
.
''
mr.
baldwin
is
also
attacking
the
greater
problem
:
lack
of
ringers
.
one
survey
says
that
of
the
100comma000
trained
bellringers
in
england
today
,
only
40comma000
of
them
still
ring
.
also
,
ringers
do
n't
always
live
where
the
bells
need
to
be
rung
--
like
in
small
,
rural
parishes
and
inner-city
churches
.
but
the
council
's
program
to
attract
and
train
ringers
is
only
partly
successful
,
says
mr.
baldwin
.
``
right
now
,
we
're
lucky
if
after
five
years
we
keep
one
new
ringer
out
of
10
,
''
he
adds
.
one
bright
sign
is
that
a
growing
number
of
women
have
entered
the
once
male-dominated
field
;
more
than
a
third
of
the
ringers
today
are
women
.
they
are
n't
accepted
everywhere
,
however
.
the
oldest
bell-ringing
group
in
the
country
,
the
ancient
society
of
college
youths
,
founded
in
1637
,
remains
male-only
,
a
fact
that
's
particularly
galling
to
women
because
the
group
is
the
sole
source
of
ringers
for
britain
's
most
prestigious
churches
,
st.
paul
's
cathedral
and
westminster
abbey
.
this
being
britain
,
no
woman
has
filed
an
equal-opportunity
suit
,
but
the
extent
of
the
problem
surfaced
this
summer
in
a
series
of
letters
to
``
the
ringing
world
,
''
a
weekly
newspaper
for
ringers
.
one
writer
,
signing
his
letter
as
``
red-blooded
,
balanced
male
,
''
remarked
on
the
``
frequency
of
women
fainting
in
peals
,
''
and
suggested
that
they
``
settle
back
into
their
traditional
role
of
making
tea
at
meetings
.
''
in
the
torrent
of
replies
that
followed
,
one
woman
ringer
from
solihull
observed
that
``
the
average
male
ringer
leaves
quite
a
lot
to
be
desired
:
badly
dressed
,
decorated
with
acne
and
a
large
beer-belly
,
frequently
unwashed
and
unbearably
flatulent
in
peals
.
''
another
women
wrote
from
sheffield
to
say
that
in
her
60
years
of
ringing
,
``
i
have
never
known
a
lady
to
faint
in
the
belfry
.
i
have
seen
one
or
two
men
die
,
bless
them
.
investors
unsettled
by
the
stock
market
's
gyrations
can
take
some
comfort
in
the
predictable
arrival
of
quarterly
dividend
checks
.
that
has
been
particularly
true
this
year
with
many
companies
raising
their
payouts
more
than
10
%
.
but
do
n't
breathe
too
easy
:
those
dividend
increases
may
signal
trouble
ahead
for
stock
prices
,
some
analysts
warn
.
in
the
past
,
they
say
,
the
strongest
dividend
growth
has
often
come
at
times
when
the
stock-market
party
was
almost
over
.
that
can
be
a
trap
for
unwary
investors
,
says
richard
bernstein
,
senior
quantitative
analyst
at
merrill
lynch
&
co
.
strong
dividend
growth
,
he
says
,
is
``
the
black
widow
of
valuation
''
--
a
reference
to
the
female
spiders
that
attract
males
and
then
kill
them
after
mating
.
stephen
boesel
,
president
of
t.
rowe
price
growth
and
income
fund
,
explains
that
companies
raise
their
payouts
most
robustly
only
after
the
economy
and
corporate
profits
have
been
growing
for
some
time
.
``
invariably
,
those
strong
periods
in
the
economy
give
way
to
recessionary
environments
,
''
he
says
.
``
and
recessionary
environments
are
n't
hospitable
to
the
stock
market
.
''
indeed
,
analysts
say
that
payouts
have
sometimes
risen
most
sharply
when
prices
were
already
on
their
way
down
from
cyclical
peaks
.
in
1976
,
for
example
,
dividends
on
the
stocks
in
standard
&
poor
's
500-stock
index
soared
10
%
,
following
much
slower
growth
the
year
before
.
the
s&p
index
started
sliding
in
price
in
september
1976
,
and
fell
12
%
in
1977
--
despite
a
15
%
expansion
in
dividends
that
year
.
that
pattern
has
n't
always
held
,
but
recent
strong
growth
in
dividends
makes
some
market
watchers
anxious
.
payouts
on
the
s&p
500
stocks
rose
10
%
in
1988
,
according
to
standard
&
poor
's
corp.
,
and
wall
street
estimates
for
1989
growth
are
generally
between
9
%
and
14
%
.
many
people
believe
the
growth
in
dividends
will
slow
next
year
,
although
a
minority
see
double-digit
gains
continuing
.
meanwhile
,
many
market
watchers
say
recent
dividend
trends
raise
another
warning
flag
:
while
dividends
have
risen
smartly
,
their
expansion
has
n't
kept
pace
with
even
stronger
advances
in
stock
prices
.
as
a
result
,
the
market
's
dividend
yield
--
dividends
as
a
percentage
of
price
--
has
slid
to
a
level
that
is
fairly
low
and
unenticing
by
historical
standards
.
put
another
way
,
the
decline
in
the
yield
suggests
stocks
have
gotten
pretty
rich
in
price
relative
to
the
dividends
they
pay
,
some
market
analysts
say
.
they
are
keeping
a
close
watch
on
the
yield
on
the
s&p
500
.
the
figure
is
currently
about
3.3
%
,
up
from
3.2
%
before
the
recent
market
slide
.
some
analysts
say
investors
should
run
for
the
exits
if
a
sustained
market
rebound
pushes
the
yield
below
3
%
.
a
drop
below
that
3
%
benchmark
``
has
always
been
a
strong
warning
sign
that
stocks
are
fully
valued
,
''
says
mr.
boesel
of
t.
rowe
price
.
in
fact
,
``
the
market
has
always
tanked
.
always
.
there
's
never
been
an
exception
,
''
says
gerald
w.
perritt
,
a
chicago
investment
adviser
and
money
manager
,
based
on
a
review
of
six
decades
of
stock-market
data
.
the
last
time
the
s&p
500
yield
dropped
below
3
%
was
in
the
summer
of
1987
.
stockholders
who
took
the
hint
and
sold
shares
escaped
the
october
debacle
.
there
have
been
only
seven
other
times
--
in
1929
,
1933
,
1961
,
1965
,
1968
,
1971
and
1972
--
when
the
yield
on
the
s&p
500
dropped
below
3
%
for
at
least
two
consecutive
months
,
mr.
perritt
found
.
and
in
each
case
,
he
says
,
a
sharp
drop
in
stock
prices
began
within
a
year
.
still
,
some
market
analysts
say
the
current
3.3
%
reading
is
n't
as
troublesome
as
it
might
have
been
in
years
past
.
``
it
's
not
a
very
meaningful
indicator
currently
because
corporations
are
not
behaving
in
a
traditional
manner
,
''
says
james
h.
coxon
,
head
of
stock
investments
for
cigna
corp.
,
the
philadelphia-based
insurer
.
in
particular
,
mr.
coxon
says
,
businesses
are
paying
out
a
smaller
percentage
of
their
profits
and
cash
flow
in
the
form
of
dividends
than
they
have
historically
.
so
,
while
stock
prices
may
look
fairly
high
relative
to
dividends
,
they
are
not
excessive
relative
to
the
underlying
corporate
strength
.
rather
than
increasing
dividends
,
some
companies
have
used
cash
to
buy
back
some
of
their
shares
,
notes
steven
g.
einhorn
,
co-chairman
of
the
investment
policy
committee
at
goldman
,
sachs
&
co
.
he
factors
that
into
the
market
yield
to
get
an
adjusted
yield
of
about
3.6
%
.
that
is
just
a
tad
below
the
average
of
the
past
40
years
or
so
,
he
says
.
what
will
happen
to
dividend
growth
next
year
?
common
wisdom
suggests
a
single-digit
rate
of
growth
,
reflecting
a
weakening
in
the
economy
and
corporate
profits
.
painewebber
inc.
,
for
instance
,
is
forecasting
growth
in
s&p
500
dividends
of
just
under
5
%
in
1990
,
down
from
an
estimated
11
%
this
year
.
in
other
years
in
which
there
have
been
moderate
economic
slowdowns
--
the
environment
the
firm
expects
in
1990
--
the
change
in
dividends
ranged
from
a
gain
of
4
%
to
a
decline
of
1
%
,
according
to
painewebber
analyst
thomas
doerflinger
.
the
minority
argument
,
meanwhile
,
is
that
businesses
have
the
financial
wherewithal
this
time
around
to
declare
sharply
higher
dividends
even
if
their
earnings
weaken
.
dividend
growth
on
the
order
of
12
%
is
expected
by
both
mr.
coxon
of
cigna
and
mr.
einhorn
of
goldman
sachs
.
those
dividend
bulls
argue
that
corporations
are
in
the
unusual
position
of
having
plenty
of
cash
left
over
after
paying
dividends
and
making
capital
expenditures
.
one
indicator
investors
might
want
to
watch
is
the
monthly
tally
from
standard
&
poor
's
of
the
number
of
public
companies
adjusting
their
dividends
.
a
total
of
139
companies
raised
dividends
in
october
,
basically
unchanged
from
138
a
year
ago
,
s&p
said
wednesday
.
that
followed
four
straight
months
in
which
the
number
of
increases
trailed
the
year-earlier
pace
.
while
the
s&p
tally
does
n't
measure
the
magnitude
of
dividend
changes
,
a
further
slippage
in
the
number
of
dividend
increases
could
be
a
harbinger
of
slower
dividend
growth
next
year
.
in
any
case
,
opinion
is
mixed
on
how
much
of
a
boost
the
overall
stock
market
would
get
even
if
dividend
growth
continues
at
double-digit
levels
.
mr.
einhorn
of
goldman
sachs
estimates
the
stock
market
will
deliver
a
12
%
to
15
%
total
return
from
appreciation
and
dividends
over
the
next
12
months
--
vs.
a
``
cash
rate
of
return
''
of
perhaps
7
%
or
8
%
if
dividend

story
on
the
renewed
plight
of
western
union
says
that
western
union
had
lost
its
chance
to
be
in
the
telephone
business
by
turning
down
alexander
graham
bell
's
offer
to
it
of
his
invention
,
because
it
supposedly
felt
that
voice
communication
would
never
replace
the
telegraph
.
such
is
hardly
the
case
.
bell
's
father-in-law
,
gardner
g.
hubbard
,
wealthy
and
well-connected
,
obtained
financing
to
start
the
american
bell
telephone
co.
in
boston
,
which
even
had
a
subsidiary
in
new
york
called
the
telephone
co.
of
new
york
.
this
is
where
bell
's
patents
went
.
western
union
indeed
wanted
to
get
into
the
telephone
business
.
it
acquired
thomas
edison
's
microphone
patent
and
then
immediately
sued
the
bell
co.
claiming
that
the
microphone
invented
by
my
grandfather
,
emile
berliner
,
which
had
been
sold
to
bell
for
a
princely
$
50comma000
,
infringed
upon
western
union
's
edison
patent
.
when
bell
established
that
the
berliner
patent
caveat
was
registered
10
days
before
edison
's
application
,
western
union
dropped
the
lawsuit
and
agreed
never
to
enter
the
telephone
business

basis
for

it
was

's
first
visit
to
china
in
1972
that
set
in
motion
the
historic
rapprochement
between
beijing
and
washington
.
but
the
former
u.s.
president
's
sixth
visit
to
china
,
during
which
he
spoke
at
length
with
chinese
leaders
,
was
nowhere
near
as
successful
at
easing
strains
that
have
recently
afflicted
the
sino-u.s.
relationship
.
mr.
nixon
,
the
most
prominent
american
to
come
to
china
since
beijing
's
bloody
suppression
of
pro-democracy
demonstrators
in
june
,
harped
on
international
outrage
over
the
massacre
.
the
chinese
,
in
turn
,
took
aim
at
american
``
interference
''
in
china
's
domestic
affairs
.
one
official
newspaper
,
legal
daily
,
even
directly
criticized
mr.
nixon
,
who
is
normally
referred
to
here
as
an
``
old
friend
.
''
the
paper
accused
him
of
being
a
leading
proponent
of
``
peaceful
evolution
,
''
a
catch
phrase
to
describe
what
china
believes
is
the
policy
of
western
countries
to
seduce
socialist
nations
into
the
capitalist
sphere
.
the
tension
was
evident
on
wednesday
evening
during
mr.
nixon
's
final
banquet
toast
,
normally
an
opportunity
for
reciting
platitudes
about
eternal
friendship
.
instead
,
mr.
nixon
reminded
his
host
,
chinese
president
yang
shangkun
,
that
americans
have
n't
forgiven
china
's
leaders
for
the
military
assault
of
june
3-4
that
killed
hundreds
,
and
perhaps
thousands
,
of
demonstrators
.
``
many
in
the
united
states
,
including
many
friends
of
china
,
believe
the
crackdown
was
excessive
and
unjustified
,
''
mr.
nixon
told
mr.
yang
,
who
was
directly
involved
in
ordering
the
attack
.
``
the
events
of
april
through
june
damaged
the
respect
and
confidence
which
most
americans
previously
had
for
the
leaders
of
china
.
''
the
chinese
responded
in
an
equally
undiplomatic
fashion
.
in
talks
with
mr.
nixon
,
chinese
leaders
expressed
no
regret
for
the
killings
,
and
even
suggested
that
the
u.s.
was
prominently
involved
in
the
demonstrations
this
spring
.
in
a
meeting
tuesday
,
supreme
leader
,
deng
xiaoping
,
told
mr.
nixon
,
``
frankly
speaking
,
the
u.s.
was
involved
too
deeply
in
the
turmoil
and
counterrevolutionary
rebellion
which
occurred
in
beijing
not
long
ago
.
china
was
the
real
victim
and
it
is
unjust
to
reprove
china
for
it
.
''
despite
the
harsh
exchanges
,
the
u.s.
and
china
still
seem
to
be
looking
for
a
way
to
mend
relations
,
which
have
deteriorated
into
what
mr.
nixon
referred
to
as
``
the
greatest
crisis
in
chinese-american
relations
''
since
his
initial
visit
to
china
17
years
ago
.
in
his
return
toast
to
mr.
nixon
,
mr.
yang
said
the
relationship
had
reached
a
``
stalemate
.
''
relations
between
china
and
the
u.s.
have
been
tense
since
june
7
,
when
chinese
dissident
fang
lizhi
and
his
wife
,
li
shuxian
,
took
refuge
in
the
u.s.
embassy
in
beijing
.
shortly
afterwards
,
mr.
bush
imposed
a
series
of
anti-china
sanctions
,
including
suspension
of
most
high-level
talks
,
which
could
be
codified
in
u.s.
congressional
legislation
in
the
coming
weeks
.
mr.
nixon
is
traveling
in
china
as
a
private
citizen
,
but
he
has
made
clear
that
he
is
an
unofficial
envoy
for
the
bush
administration
.
mr.
nixon
met
mr.
bush
and
his
national
security
adviser
,
brent
scowcroft
,
before
coming
to
china
on
saturday
.
and
he
plans
to
brief
the
president
at
the
end
of
the
week
,
u.s.
sources
said
.
mr.
nixon
was
to
leave
china
today
.
according
to
an
american
member
of
the
nixon
party
,
the
former
president
raised
a
number
of
controversial
issues
in
his
20
hours
of
talks
with
top-level
chinese
officials
.
these
included
china
's
economic
policies
,
human
rights
and
the
question
of
mr.
fang
.
mr.
nixon
also
proposed
that
china
restore
its
participation
in
the
fulbright
program
,
a
u.s.
government-funded
academic
exchange
.
china
pulled
out
of
the
program
in
july
.
in
his
talks
,
the
former
president
urged
china
's
leaders
to
acknowledge
that
their
nation
is
part
of
the
world
community
and
welcome
the
infusion
of
outside
contacts
and
ideas
.
``
ideas
are
going
over
borders
,
and
there
's
no
sdi
ideological
weapon
that
can
shoot
them
down
,
''
he
told
a
group
of
americans
at
the
u.s.
embassy
on
wednesday
.
there
are
no
signs
,
however
,
of
china
's
yielding
on
key
issues
.
but
in
one
minor
matter
,
mr.
nixon
appears
to
have
gained
a
concession
.
in
a
meeting
with
premier
li
peng
on
monday
,
mr.
nixon
said
that
he
hoped
he
would
n't
encounter
guards
with
machine
guns
during
his
visit
to
the
u.s.
embassy
.
sure
enough
,
when
he
arrived
at
the
embassy
two
days
later
,
the
machine-gun-toting
guards
were
gone
--
for
the
first
time
in
five
months
.
a
few
blocks
away
,
at
the
u.s.
ambassador
's
residence
,
the
guards
encircling
the
compound
also
had
discarded
their
uzi-model
arms
for
the
first
time
since
early
june
.
but
the
guards
there
retained
their
pistols
,
and
a
large
contingent
of
plainclothes
police
remained
nearby
in
unmarked
cars
.
moreover
,
police
and
soldiers
continue
to
harass
americans
,
who
have
filed
several
protests
with
the
foreign
ministry
in
the
past
week
.
several
times
,
chinese
guards
have
pointed
their
automatic
rifles
at
young
children
of
u.s.
diplomats
and
clicked
the
trigger
.
the
rifles
were
n't
loaded

they
could
do
at

three
things
to
improve

raise

program
traders
are
fond
of
predicting
that
if
they
are
blocked
in
the
u.s.
,
they
will
simply
emigrate
to
foreign
stock
markets
.
but
in
london
and
tokyo
,
where
computer-driven
trading
now
plays
a
small
but
growing
role
,
traders
say
a
number
of
hurdles
loom
.
government
officials
,
especially
in
japan
,
probably
would
resist
any
onslaught
of
program
trading
by
players
trying
to
shrug
off
the
u.s.
furor
over
their
activities
and
marching
abroad
with
their
business
.
japan
is
``
very
concerned
''
about
the
possible
effects
of
program
trading
,
a
senior
japanese
official
said
after
the
oct.
13
stock
plunge
in
new
york
.
u.s.
stock-index
futures
are
n't
even
traded
in
japan
now
.
and
because
of
the
time
difference
,
the
japanese
and
the
u.s.
markets
'
trading
hours
do
n't
overlap
.
it
all
adds
up
to
a
barrier
to
american-style
index
arbitrage
,
the
most
popular
form
of
u.s.
program
trading
that
seeks
to
exploit
brief
differences
between
prices
of
stocks
in
new
york
and
the
price
of
a
futures
contract
in
chicago
based
on
those
stocks
.
about
11.6
%
of
all
program
trading
by
new
york
stock
exchange
firms
in
september
took
place
in
foreign
markets
,
according
to
big
board
data
.
yet
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
japan
racing
to
introduce
chicago-style
stock-index
futures
.
japan
's
finance
ministry
already
is
scrutinizing
institutional
investors
'
activity
to
see
whether
policy
changes
are
needed
to
cope
with
the
current
level
of
program
trading
,
said
makato
utsumi
,
vice
minister
for
international
finance
.
program
trading
has
taken
off
in
japan
since
last
year
's
introduction
of
home-market
stock-index
futures
trading
on
the
tokyo
and
osaka
stock
exchanges
.
but
regulators
are
wary
.
they
have
n't
forgotten
the
leap
in
share
prices
last
dec.
7
,
when
the
first
bout
of
foreign-led
index
arbitrage
drove
stocks
skyward
in
the
last
half-hour
of
trading
,
startling
regulators
who
thought
they
had
written
enough
rules
to
prevent
such
a
swing
.
japan
's
finance
ministry
had
set
up
mechanisms
to
limit
how
far
futures
prices
could
fall
in
a
single
session
and
to
give
market
operators
the
authority
to
suspend
trading
in
futures
at
any
time
.
``
maybe
it
was
n't
enough
,
''
a
finance
ministry
official
noted
after
the
dec.
7
surge
.
japan
's
regulators
have
since
tightened
controls
on
index-related
stock
purchases
.
tokyo
's
leading
program
traders
are
the
big
u.s.
securities
houses
,
though
the
japanese
are
playing
catch-up
.
some
u.s.
firms
,
notably
salomon
inc.
and
morgan
stanley
group
inc.
,
have
reaped
a
hefty
chunk
of
their
japanese
earnings
from
index
arbitrage
,
both
for
customers
and
for
their
own
accounts
.
(
morgan
stanley
last
week
joined
a
growing
list
of
u.s.
securities
firms
that
have
stopped
doing
index
arbitrage
for
their
own
accounts
.
)
both
deryck
c.
maughan
,
who
heads
salomon
in
tokyo
,
and
john
s.
wadsworth
,
who
heads
morgan
stanley
there
,
ascribe
a
good
part
of
their
firms
'
success
in
tokyo
to
their
ability
to
offer
sophisticated
,
futures-related
investment
strategies
to
big
institutional
clients
.
they
do
n't
have
plans
to
cut
back
.
``
it
has
not
been
disruptive
in
the
markets
here
,
''
mr.
maughan
said
.
``
the
real
difference
seems
to
be
that
the
cash
market
here
...
is
big
enough
and
liquid
enough
that
the
futures
market
is
n't
having
the
same
impact
it
does
in
america
.
''
the
british
also
are
scrutinizing
program
trades
.
index-arbitrage
trading
is
``
something
we
want
to
watch
closely
,
''
an
official
at
london
's
stock
exchange
said
.
``
we
do
n't
think
there
is
cause
for
concern
at
the
moment
.
''
london
serves
increasingly
as
a
conduit
for
program
trading
of
u.s.
stocks
.
market
professionals
said
london
has
several
attractions
.
first
,
the
trading
is
done
over
the
counter
and
is
n't
reported
on
either
the
u.s.
or
london
stock
trading
tapes
.
second
,
it
can
be
used
to
unwind
positions
before
u.s.
trading
begins
,
but
at
prices
pegged
to
the
previous
session
's
big
board
close
.
in
addition
to
the
extra
privacy
of
these
trades
,
the
transactions
can
often
be
less
expensive
to
execute
,
because
the
parties
do
n't
have
to
pay
a
floor
brokerage
fee
or
a
specialist
's
fee
.
still
,
``
much
less
{
index-arbitrage
activity
}
is
done
over
here
than
in
the
u.s.
''
said
richard
barfield
,
chief
investment
manager
at
standard
life
assurance
co.
,
which
manages
about
#
15
billion
(
$
23.72
billion
)
in
united
kingdom
institutional
funds
.
britain
has
two
main
index-arbitrage
instruments
.
a
financial
times-stock
exchange
100-share
index
option
contract
is
traded
on
the
london
stock
exchange
's
traded
options
market
.
and
an
ft-se
futures
contract
is
traded
on
the
london
international
financial
futures
exchange
.
both
contracts
have
gained
a
following
since
the
1987
global
market
crash
.
the
average
number
of
ft-se
option
contracts
traded
on
the
london
exchange
has
surged
nearly
tenfold
since
the
contract
's
launch
in
1984
.
this
year
,
the
average
of
daily
contracts
traded
totaled
9comma118
,
up
from
4comma645
a
year
earlier
and
from
917
in
1984
.
but
a
survey
early
this
summer
indicated
that
the
volume
of
index-options
trading
was
only
15
%
of
the
size
of
the
underlying
equity
market
,
exchange
officials
said
.
this
compares
with
estimates
that
the
u.s.
``
derivatives
''
market
is
perhaps
four
times
as
large
as
the
underlying
domestic
market
.
the
house
voted
to
boost
the
federal
minimum
wage
for
the
first
time
since
early
1981
,
casting
a
solid
382-37
vote
for
a
compromise
measure
backed
by
president
bush
.
the
vote
came
after
a
debate
replete
with
complaints
from
both
proponents
and
critics
of
a
substantial
increase
in
the
wage
floor
.
advocates
said
the
90-cent-an-hour
rise
,
to
$
4.25
an
hour
by
april
1991
,
is
too
small
for
the
working
poor
,
while
opponents
argued
that
the
increase
will
still
hurt
small
business
and
cost
many
thousands
of
jobs
.
but
the
legislation
reflected
a
compromise
agreed
to
on
tuesday
by
president
bush
and
democratic
leaders
in
congress
,
after
congressional
republicans
urged
the
white
house
to
bend
a
bit
from
its
previous
resistance
to
compromise
.
so
both
sides
accepted
the
compromise
,
which
would
lead
to
the
first
lifting
of
the
minimum
wage
since
a
four-year
law
was
enacted
in
1977
,
raising
the
wage
to
$
3.35
an
hour
from
$
2.65
.
under
the
measure
passed
yesterday
,
the
minimum
wage
would
rise
to
$
3.80
next
april
.
the
senate
plans
to
take
up
the
measure
quickly
and
is
expected
to
pass
it
.
``
there
are
no
smiles
about
this
bill
,
''
rep.
pat
williams
(
d.
,
mont
.
)
said
during
house
floor
debate
yesterday
.
but
``
because
it
's
all
we
've
got
,
i
'm
going
to
vote
for
it
.
''
while
the
minimum
wage
had
traditionally
been
pegged
at
half
the
average
u.s.
manufacturing
wage
,
the
level
of
$
4.25
an
hour
in
1991
will
still
be
less
than
35
%
of
average
factory

instead
praised
the
house
's
acceptance
of
a
new
youth
``
training
''
wage
,
a
subminimum
that
gop
administrations
have
sought
for
many
years
.
adopting
a
training-wage
policy
means
``
getting
beyond
the
nickel
and
diming
of
the
minimum
wage
,
''
mrs.
roukema
said
.
policy
makers
regard
the
youth
wage
as
helping
to
limit
the
loss
of
jobs
from
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
,
but
they
have
lately
touted
it
as
necessary
to
help
impart
job
skills
to
entrants
into
the
work
force
.
labor
unions
and
democrats
long
fought
the
idea
,
but
recently
acceded
to
it
in
the
face
of
bush
administration
insistence
.
the
compromise
sets
the
training
wage
at
$
3.35
an
hour
next
april
,
and
at
$
3.61
an
hour
,
or
85
%
of
the
minimum
wage
,
in
april
1991
.
employers
can
pay
the
subminimum
for
90
days
,
without
restriction
,
to
workers
with
less
than
six
months
of
job
experience
,
and
for
another
90
days
if
the
company
uses
a
government-certified
training
program
for
the
young
workers
.
the
training
wage
covers
only
workers
who
are
16
to
19
years
old
.
the
white
house
previously
insisted
on
an
unrestricted
six-month
training
wage
that
could
be
paid
any
time
a
worker
of
any
age
took
a
new
job
.
the
u.s.
chamber
of
commerce
,
still
opposed
to
any
mininum-wage
increase
,
said
the
compromise
plan
to
lift
the
wage
floor
27
%
in
two
stages
between
april
1990
and
april
1991
``
will
be
impossible
for
many
employers
to
accommodate

will
result
in
the
